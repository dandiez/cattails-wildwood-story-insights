A year later, I had never seen her happier than she was then. Isn't it a strange thing?///[sad]I guess what I'm trying to say is... we are not right for each other. I know this will not come as a surprise, #player_name#. Our relationship has been on a collision course with disaster for some time now. The love and passion and respect left long ago.///[thinking]It is with a heavy heart that I must announce that I will be leaving you. I did not come by this decision lightly, and I will not be dissuaded from my choice.///[sad]I am going soon. I wish things had not come to this.","[blushing]There is nowhere I would rather be than standing here with you, #player_name#. I do. For now and for always.","[happy]You have brought me so much joy.

Care to share a story or two? I have some time before I head out to forage.","[happy]Oh look, it's #player_name#, come to check on me! I am doing very well today, as usual. I hope you can say the same.","[shocked]Oh, you want advice on [green]gardening[/green]..? Ok, I guess...///[thinking]You need seeds, obviously. Plant those in the ground and take care of them...///[sad]If you can prove that you can take care of your plants, they should grow up healthy... I have my doubts, though.///[shocked]That's about it. Can I go now?","[happy]I'd be happy to give some advice on [green]gardening[/green]! It's my favorite hobby, after all.///[neutral]First, get some seeds. You can make seeds by processing herbs if you have the appropriate recipe available. Higher quality herbs will generate more seeds per plant, so keep that in mind.///[playful]Then, take the seeds to the garden plot and plant them. You can plant any seed in any season there. That's some first-rate soil!///[neutral]Make sure you return every single day to take care of the garden. Each plant should be given [green]Plant Food[/green] daily in order to ensure maximum growth potential.///[happy]After several days, your plant will be ready for harvesting! If you took good care of it, you'll either reap a higher quality result or a quicker harvest.///[neutral]Talk to me anytime to purchase the necessary ingredients or visit the [red]Seed Maker[/red] to turn fresh herbs into seeds. Happy [green]gardening[/green], #player_name#!","[happy]Hey, surely you know how to [green]garden[/green] by now, right?///[blushing]After all, you treat me so well, I can only imagine that you treat your garden the same way. Constant daily affection goes a long way with both cats and plants.///[neutral]But if you really want my advice, I'd say to first make seeds by processing fresh herbs. The higher the quality herb, the more seeds it will produce.///[happy]Then, plant those seeds at the garden. You can plant any seed in any season there. That's some first-rate soil!///[neutral]Make sure you tend to your new plant daily by fertilizing it with [green]Plant Food[/green].///[happy]After several days, it should sprout into a beautiful herb or flower, ready for harvesting!

The long and short of it is that I'm doing much better now that you're around. I missed you dreadfully.","[blushing]It is hard to believe that I am not dreaming when you are near.

I don't believe I've ever experienced happiness like this before.,"[playful]When I was a kitten, I always wondered what it would be like to be all grown up and in love. Now I know, and it's better than I ever could have guessed!","[happy]What are the odds that in such a vast universe, we would have found each other? I don't like to think of the alternative, but I know there could not have been a better life for me than this.","[happy]My heart stills beats for you like it did when we first started dating. This is the real deal, isn't it #player_name#? A lifelong love story that will stand the test of time. I am so glad to have found you.","[happy]You should take the day off, #player_name#! The troubles of the world will still be around tomorrow. You only get one [rainbow]birthday[/rainbow] a year, and you might as well take full advantage of it.","[happy]As the years pass, I am becoming more and more aware of how truly blessed I am to have the life that I have. Surrounded by good friends and a great #colony_title#, I am fortunate indeed.","[happy]Did you notice the flower arrangements? That's my handiwork this year. I am very proud of what I was able to come up with when #npc_name_coco# requested my help.///And mind you, if you get the chance, they smell just as good as they look!

You are an excellent example to all, and I'm so very proud of you.","[shocked]Today is the last day to gather certain summer-plants in the wild. It is always sad to me when I must say goodbye. It is like saying farewell to an old friend, full of bittersweet memories.///[happy]It makes it all the happier when they return next year. Life, after all, is an endless series of cycles.

It is such a beautiful day for a festival. I'm glad to spend it with you, #player_name#.","[neutral]When I was a kitten, I used to love this time of the year. There's something very wholesome about the way that some cats get all into the spirit of harvest-time.

What do you think, #player_name#? Is that true?","[shocked]My nose is so chilly! I might head back to the den in a little bit. You're welcome to come with me. Together we can warm it up and get settled in for a long, cold night. Doesn't that sound cozy, #player_name#?","[neutral]Herbs are abundant this time of year. It's the best possible time for gathering, if that's your sort of thing. I try to make a trip out into the wilderness every day to collect some fresh flora for my collection.///[shocked]You never know when some [green]Peppermint[/green] or [green]Goldenseal[/green] will be necessary! Very handy in a pinch, both of those are. You should spend some time getting to know all the different types of plants so that you will be ready for anything.","[thinking]The rain showers are getting less frequent. I think summer is on our doorstep, waiting to sweep the springtime away. Besides, it's gotten warmer lately. Can you tell?///[playful]I always try to spend some of the hot days of the year exploring for new places in the wild. You never know what might be lying beyond the bend of the river or hidden away behind a grove of trees!","[neutral]It's not a bad time to go for a swim. Your coat will dry out pretty fast in the summer sun. I might head down to the river tomorrow for that purpose.///[playful]Besides it being fun, it's also a great way to get clean. The rushing waters can pick the dirt out of your fur quicker than your tongue might.","[thinking]To the ancestors of my parents, the sun was nothing more than a gigantic [green]Firefly[/green] set high in the sky as a reward for completing an epic quest on behalf of the stars.///[neutral]They say a massive crystal magnifies its light and brings it down to earth for benefit of all living creatures.///[playful]What a ridiculous story! Even the brightest of [green]Fireflies[/green] is not so bright as the sun. Do you think there's something to the myth, #player_name#?","[thinking]The first of the [green]Blackberries[/green] have begun to sprout in the forests. They're not much for eating, but their juice can make quite a pretty dye, if you know what you're doing.///[shocked]Sometimes mine don't make it home, I just eat them right off the branch. A little sugary snack here and there is good for keeping up your energy when you're out exploring.","[neutral]You can learn a lot about the passage of time from watching the moon. It waxes and wanes in rhythm with the seasons. Judging from last night's moon, we're nearing the end of autumn and approaching the onslaught of winter.///[thinking]Be sure you've stored up enough food and herbs to last you through the harsh, snowy months ahead. They can be brutal if they catch you unawares.","[neutral]If you see tracks in the snow, it might be worth your time to investigate. You might stumble upon some prey and net yourself a quick meal.///[shocked]Or you might stumble across something much worse and be in for a fight! Either way, it'll be an adventure.","[thinking]This is the only time of the year when you can gather [green]Blueberries[/green]. Last year I tried to make a big pile of them so that I wouldn't run out through the year, but I ended up eating them all before the end of spring. I just can't get enough of those tasty little berries!///[happy]If you see any while you're going about your business, I certainly wouldn't mind a sample.",This is #npc_name_alabaster#'s den. It would be impolite to intrude in their private space before getting to know them better.///A beautiful colored light filters through the entryway. There is a lovely scent wafting from the door. It must be quite nice inside.,"[happy]You've come at a lucky time! I've just set out some fresh flowers that should create a lovely aroma throughout the den. Did you notice when you walked in?///[neutral]I like to keep a couple fresh blossoms around at all times. It chases the dank, earthy odors that most dens have away. Makes it much more pleasant and breathable in here.","[neutral]You may have noticed, but my den isn't exactly water-proof. I need a light drizzle to come in from the roof to keep my plants in tip-top shape. A little moisture goes a long way to preserving them for a longer period of time.///[happy]Plus, on nice days, I get a little breeze that runs through the length of the den, keeping everything fresh and wholesome. In the cold months, I cover the holes as best I can with cloth. It's not a perfect system, but it works well enough for me.","[thinking]Visitors are always welcome. I love hosting. I don't get to do it as often as I would like. Can I offer you a tour? It's not a very large space, but everything in this den has a story. I don't keep things around needlessly!","[shocked]I don't usually have such prominent cats over. I never thought #leader_title_with_article# would stop by! Luckily, as a rule I'm a pretty tidy cat, so nothing is out of place.///[playful]I'm happy you stopped by unannounced. When someone tells me that they're coming over, I tend to stress out about it and spend the entire day cleaning before they arrive. This way, I haven't wasted my time!","[happy]After a hard trek to arrived at this far country, I'm glad to have such a clean and proper place to live. Many times along the journey I wondered if I would ever dwell in a nice den again. Staying outside in the harsh weather and unprotected can lead one to have such thoughts with distressing regularity.///[playful]I'm happy to report that this den has exceeded my expectations. You've created a very comfortable #colony_title# to live in, #player_name#. Thank you.","[thinking]If there's anything I can do to make my den more comfortable for you when you come over, please let me know #player_name#. I want you to feel welcomed here, because you are welcome any time.///[happy]I really enjoy spending time with you!","[happy]I feel like we're on a date or something, but in my own home. How strange and wonderful at the same time! Something about having you around is simultaneously stressful and relaxing. I guess that's just how dating goes in general, though. Ha!","[blushing]I heard you rustling about outside and tried to tidy up before you came in. I hope things are to your liking, #player_name#. I didn't have time to sweep the floor, though, so watch for loose petals and thorns as you walk around, especially near the back.","[happy]Hey, handsome! Did you stop by to see if I was free for a date or an adventure? Or maybe both? If so, the answer is yes! I've missed you terribly.","[playful]I've always felt at home in my home, but it feels more homely when you're in my home, too. Bit of a tongue-twister, but it's true nonetheless. I don't know if that even makes sense.","[neutral]So many cats wish they could find more hours in their days, but you and I have found the secret! It is, of course, to get up early and start your day before everybody else. It isn't always fun, but it pays dividends.",[neutral]I like to take a stroll in the morning after breakfast. It helps get the mind started and ready for the day. A little exercise is a great way to begin each morning.,"[playful]The sun's barely up, but here you are and here I am! I like to make it a race. A race against the sun!///[shocked]It's harder to win that race in the summer, and a lot easier in the winter.","[thinking]It's too dark, otherwise I'd be out foraging for herbs. I've still got plenty of energy. Oh well, I guess I'll have to head to bed sooner or later. Best to have two full days than one overly-full day and one where you're dead-tired.///[neutral]It's all about pacing yourself!","[neutral]Out on the night-watch, I presume? Some predators, like [green]Bats[/green], only come out of hiding once the sun goes down. You never know what might be lurking just past the borders, waiting until the perfect moment to strike.","[neutral]You look like you've had a long day, #player_name#. I'm sure you have stories to tell. You might want to hit the sack. Cats who go to bed too late often find themselves accidentally sleeping in much later than they would have liked.///[thinking]Besides, your mind needs time to process the day. That's one thing that sleep is great for. Even when you're fast asleep, your mind is working overtime. Isn't that wonderful?","[neutral]On days like these, it's hard to think about work. You just want to stretch out in the sun and soak it all in.///[thinking]Can I tell you a secret? Sometimes I do just that. I take the day off when the weather is nice and I'm not feeling mentally prepared for work. I know that's not what most cats do, but it's helped me tremendously. Might be worth trying for yourself!","[happy]Isn't this fun? The clouds have come down to earth to say hello to us cat-folk. It's not every day that you get to touch a cloud.///[playful]I guess it doesn't concern me as much as it might concern other cats because my work is largely unaffected. Plants don't move or scare easily, and I find them by scent anyways so I don't really rely on my eyesight as much as you might think.","[playful]Cheer up! A little rain never hurt anybody. It's great for washing out your fur, too. I think the rain is nature's way of resetting the world and keeping it clean and orderly.///[neutral]Plus, without the rain, we wouldn't have flowers to smell or berries to eat! It's important to practice a spirit of gratitude towards things like rain.","[shocked]I don't remember the last time my toes got so cold. It feels as though they'll never get warm ever again.///[neutral]Of course, I know that's not true. I'm being dramatic, this is all a normal part of the cycles of the world. It's hard to appreciate the warmth of summer if you haven't lived in the cold.","[angry]There's so much static in the air, my fur is standing on end! I wish this lightning would stop and never come back. It's hard to think or sleep when the sky is at war like this.","[sad]It's been a hard winter already, and this blizzard is only multiplying its difficulties. We should both make it a point to check in with everyone else when the snow stops falling. These sorts of days can wreak havoc on cats who were caught unprepared.///[shocked]I would hate to see my #colony_title#-mates struggling in this bitter cold! I'll help any way I can.","[shocked]#player_name#, you are not well! You must promise me you will take better care of yourself. I do not like to see you in such a pitiful state!","[neutral]Did I just hear your stomach rumble, #player_name#? Seems to me that a meal would do you some good right now.///[shocked]Surely you have something you can eat? If not, there's plenty of [green]Mice[/green] to go around, you've just got to catch one first.","[sad]A shadow falls upon my heart when you approach, #player_name#. It cautions me not to get involved in your affairs. Only trouble that way lies.","[neutral]There is no better way to spend one's time than by speaking with a stranger. When we talk to someone we do not know, we increase our capacity for empathy and gain fascinating insight into the world around us.///[happy]We have more in common with all other cats than you might think at first glance!///[neutral]So now you must tell me a story, #player_name#. Something that will open my eyes to a new perspective. I will listen as best I can and try to hear the meaning behind your words.","[thinking]I am glad to speak with you, #player_name#. It must be difficult to be #leader_title_with_article#. Tell me, stranger, what it is like to walk a mile in your paws?///[neutral]As for myself, my life is easy and my days are joyful. After all, my needs are met by the exceptional cats of our #colony_title#! When I go out to gather herbs in the wilds, I do it with a full heart, knowing that my contribution to our community stretches further than I could ever realize.",[neutral]There are many tales which cats have passed down for centuries. I wonder how they have become twisted with time? Certainly there must be some level of overstatement or exaggeration in each of them.///[shocked]How can we know for sure what is truth and what is myth? We must use our brains in conjunction with our hearts to judge what we hear.,"[thinking]I am humbled to speak with you, #player_name#. I recognize that you have a great destiny ahead of you, and indeed behind you as well. I had heard of your deeds before I ever ventured out to the Wildwood in search of your lands.///[neutral]Why else would I have come, if not for the promise of a better life under the wise guidance of a strong and venerable #leader_title#?///[playful]It is no good to leave your life unexamined. At every crossroads, one must ask oneself: Will the choice I make now affect my future, and will it be for the better or not?///[neutral]Of course, there is some level of risk with any choice. My decision to leave the comforts of my homelands and move to this strange frontier was fraught with possible dangers on all sides, but I came nonetheless.","[shocked]There are so many cats here! Back home, I was not surrounded by such a large group.///[neutral]It is a good thing, of course, but the adjustment will take me some time to get used to. It is why I enjoy going out in the wilds to search for herbs. I get a little alone time with my thoughts, away from the hustle and bustle of the village!","[happy]What a day to be alive! Revel in the joys that each day brings, #player_name#.///[thinking]I asked a budding [green]Goldenseal[/green] plant how it was feeling this morning. From the radiant shine on its green, leafy petals, I could assume it would reply that it is doing just fine.///[neutral]It has no cares as it sits in the sun, waving with the breeze. We all could learn a thing or two from that [green]Goldenseal[/green] plant.","[neutral]You are something of an explorer, are you not, #player_name#? I cannot imagine how a cat could pick up and move to the middle of a wilderness like this unless that were the case.///[thinking]It takes a certain strength of spirit to venture headfirst into the unknown without fear. You possess a unique talent for discovery and a love of questing that is unmatched in all the cats I have met.///[neutral]After all, you range wide and far from home often, it seems. Does that not align with what I have just told you?","[thinking]Sometimes I enjoy the company of growing things more than the company of other cats. The flowers of the field do not complain or whimper or cry. They do not fight or rip or tear. They are content to simply be.///[neutral]If only every cat could follow their example. What it would be like to improve the world with undeniable beauty, but ask for nothing in return! I can only imagine.","[neutral]You are a deep well of knowledge, #player_name#. As I get to know you, I am perpetually fascinated by the stories you carry with you.///[playful]Talking to you is like peeling back layer upon layer of information and history. There is always something new to be uncovered!///[neutral]How curious and intriguing. One day, I will get to the bottom of it all!","[neutral]I have many friends in this world. I know them by name. [green]Goldenseal[/green] and [green]Peppermint[/green] and [green]Lavender[/green]. The fruits of the soil, which sprout forth in vibrant waves of color and sights and smells.///[happy]I am comforted in their presence, and I consider myself a caretaker of their well-being. With love and tenderness, all living things are improved.","[neutral]Fierce in a fight, yet fast in friendship. That's how I would describe you, #player_name#. You have shown me support and friendship and no small deal of kindness.///[thinking]I wonder how you would describe me?","[thinking]When I was a kitten, my littermates teased me for my strange, pale eyes. I was ashamed of them for many years, because they do not look the same as the eyes of the cats I knew.///[playful]With many years of effort, I've come to terms with the fact that my eyes are a part of what makes me special. I am unique and I am valuable. Even my eyes.","[neutral]We cats are not the only creatures that seek out various plants for their multitude of useful properties. I caught a [green]Rat[/green] snacking on an herb out in the woods, and I dispatched of the rodent as quickly as I could.///[neutral]A word of advice, if you ever tangle with a [green]Rat[/green]. Mind the teeth! Rats are often infected with various diseases and are thusly poisonous to us cats. Take some [green]Honeycomb[/green] or [green]Marigold[/green] with you to be extra safe.","[happy]I am glad we have gotten to know each other, #player_name#. I had feared that our difference in social standing would keep you at a metaphorical arms-length, but you are more down to earth than I originally gave you credit for.///[thinking]Not every #leader_title# is as personable as you, #player_name#. It is part of what makes living here so enjoyable for me. Thank you.","[neutral]You have ranged far and wide in your travels, #player_name#. And you seem to always be carrying things of the strangest sort. Some day I must ask that you show me the odd and wonderful curios you collect when you go adventuring.","[happy]I once said that there is no better way to spend your time than by talking with a stranger. As it turns out, I was incorrect. There is one better way to spend one's time: Talking with a good friend.///[playful]How enriching a simple conversation can be!","[neutral]Be mindful of your health, #player_name#. I have seen too many cats let stress and busyness cloud their judgement when it comes time to take care of themselves.///[shocked]Be certain that you set aside time everyday for leisure and self-improvement. You will be better off in the long run if you heed this advice.","[playful]If you ever have need of something from me, I would be happy to oblige. You are my friend, #player_name#, and I support you wholeheartedly.///[neutral]I do not like to see my friends in need. And why should I be stingy, when I have been blessed with so much?","[happy]I am beyond blessed. I have everything I could ever need. When you work hard towards your goals, you may find that you can say the same some day.///[playful]For me, my goals were easy to achieve, because I intentionally set them lower than most. Besides a den, a community, and a few things to call my own, what else could I possibly want?","[neutral]Have you ever sat on the riverbank and watched the water roll by? I often make the trek to the water to do so. There is nothing else like water in all of nature.///[playful]It can be full of peace, life, and abundance when you view it on a warm summer day. Or, it can be a herald of woe and a bringer of destruction when it is observed in a storm. How marvelous water can be.","[sad]You've caught me at a bad time. Maybe later?///[shocked]I do not mean to offend, #player_name#. Especially not you. But I am not in the mood for light conversation at the moment.","[neutral]I am so grateful to have met you, #player_name#. There are many joys in my life, but the greatest at the moment is our relationship. I am excited to see how things progress between the two of us.///[happy]We need not think too long and hard about the future! What matters is the present. We have each other for the moment, and that is enough. Revel in the day that we are living before tending to the unknown.","[happy]Do you know why I smile? I'd wager a bet that you can guess it easily.///[thinking]I'll give you a hint... it's because you are here.///[shocked]Oh no, I've given away the answer! That was no hint after all. Hrm. I will need to think up a new riddle for you now.","[blushing]How do you do it, #player_name#? You always have the best ideas. I'm certain that you have a date or adventure in mind. I can tell from your smile.///[playful]You must tell me what you are plotting! You cannot leave poor #npc_name_alabaster# in the dark!","[neutral]I have gone through many trials. My past is dotted with bleak times and hard circumstances. I do not talk about them openly to anyone.///[thinking]The reason I keep these things to myself is that I choose to not dwell on them. What has happened has happened, and cannot be changed. However, I have control over how I respond today and how I will respond tomorrow. That is what matters most to me.","[thinking]I am having trouble thinking up a name for you, #player_name#. You see, #player_name# is a fine name, but it is not fitting for you. You are kind and wise and gentle and caring. #player_name# does not capture the full picture, you see.///[shocked]I will think of a word that can describe you sooner or later! It is a difficult task. Much more difficult than I imagined when I set out on this mission.///[neutral]I have never been one to struggle with words. How ironic this situation is!","[neutral]Your presence reassures me that you have your priorities aligned well. We cannot always be off at war or working in the mines. We must make time for the more important, finer things in life.///[happy]Things like a good meal, a hearty laugh, a fruitful conversation. Time for love and time for peace and time for gentle conversation set to the tune of a delicate breeze.///[thinking]You may call me a romantic or soft-hearted, but it will not change my deeply held conviction. This world was not made for toiling or fighting our lives away.","[thinking]I am taking a break. In fact, I have taken the entire day off of my duties. There are far too many experiences available to us to devote our entire lives to labor in the fields.///[happy]Come, be merry with me! Sing a song and dance among the wildflowers and whistle a jolly tune of love and adventure. It is no bad thing to play the day away, and it is certainly not a waste.///[thinking]Of course, you cannot spend [b]all[/b] your days like so. Labor has its purpose, and it should be respected and honored for what it can provide. Everything must be done in its proper time and in its proper way.","[blushing]It is not often that I get the chance to speak so freely as I do when you are near. Not every cat appreciates my attitudes nor listens with so attentive an ear as you.///[playful]To be fully transparent, I find it rather attractive. It is, perhaps, your finest trait. You have the heart of a listener.///[happy]You could not be dating me if it were not so! I'm sure I would have run you off long ago if you were not prepared or equipped for listening at length to all manner of things.","[happy]I often whistle a tune while I am out searching for flowers. This practice is not common, because it scares away prey. I do not care who hears, so I whistle as loud as I feel. Flowers and herbs do not scare so easily.///[neutral]The tune is one I made myself. Some days, I refine it or add to it. It has grown quite lengthy.///[thinking]Perhaps one day I will sing it for you? Then you can judge its merit!","[happy]At night, I go to bed with a full heart, feeling completely at peace with the world. Perhaps this is what many cats experience every day, but it is still fresh and exciting to me.///[playful]I wake up rejuvenated and delighted to start the day! There are so many things I wish to do! The future, shrouded in all its mystery, seems to only hold good paths for me.","[neutral]I would like to redecorate my den today. Perhaps I will move my herbs to the other side of the den to open up room for a new window.///[thinking]There is nothing like rearranging your living space when it comes to feeling like a new cat! It somehow opens the mind to new possibilities in a way that seems impossible until you give it a try.///[happy]Of course, your den is quite stylish already, #player_name#. I am not suggesting you need to rearrange anything, but if you get in the mood for a new style, try it out. You may be surprised how much you like it after you're done!","[happy]Did you happen to catch the sunset yesterday night? How glorious it was! Like a giant ball of fire descending swiftly below the horizon. Then, the whole world was engulfed in peaceful silence and shadow.///[neutral]It filled my heart with a great longing, though I do not know what for. My mind has been wandering all morning, searching for the meaning of it. It's like when you wake up mid-way through a dream and cannot remember what you dreamt of.///[shocked]How frustrating it is to be unable to find the answer!","[playful]Perhaps I'll take a nap. It seems as good a time as any to doze off. Unless you had something in mind, #player_name#?///[happy]If not, you're welcome to join me. Fair warning, I do snore a bit. Oh, and sometimes I sneeze in my sleep.///[blushing]I should not have told you that! I do not know why I said that. Sorry, you can ignore me.","[angry]I was just about to pick a beautiful [green]Foxglove[/green] bloom, when all of a sudden #npc_name_spark# came sprinting through the area and trampled my poor [green]Foxglove[/green] plant into the ground! Tore it to pieces and absolutely ruined it.///[thinking]Maybe you can talk some sense into them, #player_name#. As you know, it is not often that I get flustered like this. Given enough time, I'm sure I will calm down and come to forgive #npc_name_spark#.///[angry]But it is ever so difficult to convince myself right now!","[neutral]Have you ever stumbled upon a wild beehive, #player_name#? Many cats fear them, but I do not believe this is wise.///[thinking]To my parents, the [green]Bees[/green] were the tenders of the gardens of the world. It is said that the humble [green]Bee[/green] goes to great lengths to spread beautiful, colorful flowers all across the lands for everyone to enjoy. What do you think of that, #player_name#?///[neutral]I believe it is a lesson that even the smallest among us have a part to play in the story of the world. And that even the smallest among us must not be overlooked, lest a 'sharp' reminder be given to the one who does the overlooking! Ha!","[blushing]I had a dream last night that we were off together, living in some lonely cave far away from everyone else. It was strange because, although we were completely alone, I felt safe and happy knowing you were by my side.","[happy]I am a simple cat, #player_name#. There are not many things that I need in order to be content.///[blushing]However, there is one [green]thing[/green] that I would not mind having... Can you guess what that may be?///[playful]I will leave it as a mystery for you to solve. Ha ha!","[blushing]I am nearly brought to tears when I think of all the blessings that I have. It is necessary to be grateful for the luxuries you have, lest you forget that they were hard-won.///[thinking]I hope I never lose this feeling of appreciation I have. It is a humbling emotion, and very good to experience from time to time.","[happy]Would you like to go on a walk? I find that getting some fresh air out in the woods is helpful for processing my thoughts. Forward motion in the body somehow encourages forward motion in the mind, it seems.","[playful]Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a bird? To fly free in the sky, away from the troubles of the world below?///[thinking]They do not seem to care for our petty cat politics. They are in a world apart, fluttering from branch to branch and tree to tree without a second thought.///[neutral]It is sad to see them brought low by a hungry feline. I think they deserve better than that, don't you? We should respect them for the way they grace our skies and remind us that even to the most powerful of cats, there are things beyond our reach.///[thinking]I find that oddly comforting.",[sad]I feel a strange mix of emotions. Sadness and grief and longing. What do you think it must mean?,"[neutral]A bigger den means more cleaning to do. I am not used to caring for so large a space, and your den is generously proportioned.///[happy]Not that I am complaining! When there are twice as many paws to do the work, it goes more than twice as fast.","[happy]I heard the birds chirping outside the den and I could not help myself but join them in their song.///[shocked]Of course, that scared them all off, and then I was left alone singing all by myself.///[playful]Maybe you can pick up where they left off? My heart is so happy it cannot be contained, and it overflows into song!","[playful]Do you feel that gentle breeze? Where do you think it comes from?///[happy]It has no beginning and no ending, and nothing can stop it in its path. I don't think the wind cares about all the little problems and politics of cats. It's very inspiring.","[happy]Tomorrow I might head out to look for some flowers for the den. Do you have any in particular you'd like me to collect? Otherwise I'll try to just get a bunch of different ones.///[playful]The best flower arrangements display a mastery of contrast and color. But you must avoid the foul-smelling flowers! [green]Marigold[/green] looks pretty, but if you touch it, you'll unleash a putrid scent.","[blushing]Do you remember when you gave me that [green]Red Rose[/green]? I did my best to keep it alive for as long as I could. I fetched fresh water in a bowl made of leaves every day for its stem and plucked and pruned it when it needed to be patched up.///[thinking]It made it for quite a while, but one day the decay set in and it died, despite my best efforts.///[neutral]I think that is the fate of all living things, sad as it is. We must have the wisdom to be able to let them go when their time here is done.///[happy]Lucky for me, our love isn't tied to that flower. It was just a symbol anyways. I still have you, and I'm grateful for that every morning when I wake up!","[neutral]I don't know if I've ever told you this, but I tried [green]Stoat[/green] once and I really liked the taste. They're tricky to find and trickier to deal with, but if you ever see one, make sure you save a bite for me, OK?///[playful]If you haven't tried it, you're in for a real treat!","[happy]It took me some time, but I'm finally starting to settle in after the move. I didn't sleep very well for a while, but last night I slept like a rock.///[playful]New experiences sometimes take some time to get used to. Maybe I take more time to adjust than most, I don't know.","[neutral]You lead a dangerous life, #player_name#. Not only is it risky business leading #colony_full_name_with_article#, but it's also dangerous because you seem to always be getting into fights.///[happy]I'm very proud of you for facing the challenges ahead of you with such gusto! Someone needs to protect the borders so that the rest of us can sleep peacefully. You are a great inspiration to everyone who lives here, #player_name#. I am sure of it.","[blushing]I had a dream the other night. It was one of those long-winding, constantly changing sorts of dreams that only happen once in a while.///[shocked]I was running through a dimly-lit forest full of bugs and glowing eyes, looking for shelter and ducking under low-hanging branches as I ran.///[thinking]Right when I thought I was caught by a ferocious creature that I could not see, I woke up. And I was in the den, and you were there next to me.///[happy]I felt better in an instant. Thanks, #player_name#.","[playful]I knew when we first met that you were a special cat. Something told me we would end up being good friends, and I think I may have remarked something of the sort to you then.///[happy]Fortunately, my intuition was correct! Here we are, married and everything. It's funny how that gut feeling can happen and end up being true. I wonder what it means?","[thinking]Perhaps I will venture down to the wetlands tomorrow. There are several plants that thrive in those bog-like conditions that you will not find elsewhere.///[neutral]Plus, as an added bonus, you sometimes happen across a [green]Frog[/green] or a [green]Lizard[/green] for lunch. Yummy! So salty and crunchy and sweet.///[shocked]My mouth is watering just thinking about it!","[neutral]I wish we had some of the flowers from our wedding around still. I know that they must have wilted long ago, but I can still remember them each in my mind.///[happy]Such beautiful blooms and delicate petals! It would be fun to try to recreate the arrangements. Maybe that's what I'll do today.","[thinking]#npc_name_alabaster# and #player_name#. What a lovely phrase. Rolls right off the tongue, wouldn't you say?///[neutral]It is no coincidence that we met. I believe there was a hand guiding our fates. There is no chance that this all happened by accident. Perhaps it was #npc_name_theforestguardian#, or someone like them.","[playful]I was taught from a young age that relationships are hard work. There is a lot of wisdom in that teaching. A good relationship cannot spring from nothing. It involves a great effort from both parties in order to make it a success.///[happy]I am glad that we both are doing our part to make the other feel special. I know how hard you work to make me happy, and I am so proud of you for it.///[shocked]I only hope I can return the favor. I know I'm trying to!",[shocked]I realized this morning that I've been categorizing [green]Goldenseal[/green] wrong for years.///[angry]Now I have to reorganize my entire collection!! How frustrating.,"[happy]Do you know how I feel about you? I truly love you, #player_name#. I know I've told you before, but it's important to tell those you love often how you care about them so that they do not ever forget it.///[playful]And I know that you love me too. We have grown so much together as a couple. It is hard to remember what it was like to be single and solo.","[playful]You know, if you ever want to know more about the plants that grow out in the wild, I would be happy to give you a lesson. And not just the herbs! There are also trees and bushes and grasses that deserve to be known.///[neutral]It took me several years to learn how to tell them all apart, and there are some growing around here that I have yet to determine what they may be. But for the most part, I've got it figured out.///[happy]You don't have to entertain me if you don't want to. I know I get more passionate about this stuff than most. I'm just extra excited about it today because I just stumbled across a new one I hadn't seen before.","[playful]I still remember what it was like when you first approached me with that [green]Red Rose[/green]. I thought it would never happen, but I was hoping against hope that it would.///[blushing]I may not have shown it at the time, but I was quite surprised to see you standing there with that flower held out for me. It was as though time stopped, and we were left staring into each others eyes, full of fear for what this might mean, but also excitement.///[happy]I am so glad that I said 'yes' to you that day. You changed my life when you picked me, #player_name#. I will never forget that.","[happy]Cats aren't much different than plants, you know. We all need to be nurtured and checked on daily. Our needs aren't really all that mysterious either.///[thinking]Things gets complicated when cats start hiding their emotions and intentions. If we were all as open and honest as you and I, the world would be a better place.///[playful]We could all learn a thing or two from things that grow.","[blushing]I know it's been a while since we started our relationship, but I still get swept away when I see you walk by. It's a complicated mix of love and desire and passion.///[shocked]Oh, that's very embarrassing. Perhaps even cheesy. Sorry, I should have kept that to myself!","[neutral]Are you enjoying your time as a parent? I have heard it is one of the most rewarding things a cat can do with their life, #player_name#.///[happy]What a gift it must be to experience such love! It is clear from your actions that you care quite deeply for your family. All those in #colony_title_with_article# can see it.",[playful]What a cheerful flower you wear on your head. Let it serve as a constant reminder of the symbiotic bond shared between the plants that grow beneath our paws and the delicate cats who nurture them.,"[thinking]There is nothing wrong with taking a short rest from your duties. Come, #player_name#, sit with me a moment and let your mind be at ease.///[neutral]I know the troubles that must rest on your shoulders are immense. It is the burden of leadership. But there is no shame in taking a moment to catch your breath.","[playful]My spirit is always lifted when I take a stroll around the streets of our great #colony_title#. You have made a comfortable settlement for us all, #player_name#.","[thinking]This is where some of my best thinking can happen. Out and about in the forest, where there are few cats around to disturb the tranquility of my thoughts.///[shocked]Oh, I meant no offense, #player_name#! Your company is always welcomed. I simply meant to state that it is important for our brains to spend some time in nature.///[happy]Helps us to process the world around us better, I think.","[neutral]I have spent the last season growing fresh [green]Goldenseal[/green] plants in the garden. I always like to drop a pile off at the clinic for #npc_name_krampy# as a gift.///[happy]What better way to use one's paws than to be instrumental in the healing of others' hurts? For my purposes, that is enough.",[neutral]I still to this day can't believe how lucky I am that #npc_name_fliss# said 'yes' to marrying me.///[blushing]That was the best day of my life.,"[blushing]I view #npc_name_lainey# as a sibling now. It is interesting how different they are from #npc_name_fliss#.///[happy]Honestly, #npc_name_lainey# used to bother me when we first met, but they have matured much recently. I am very proud of them.","[happy]#npc_name_fliss# is as elegant as a flower. And our love continues to blossom and grow.///[blushing]I wish the same love will in your life, #player_name#.",[shocked]I think I saw #npc_name_salem# running away from the garden with something in their mouth. Did you happen to see what they had?///[thinking]I did a full inventory but nothing seems to be missing. How strange.,[neutral]I feel as though a great burden upon my soul has been lifted. The very air seems lighter. Colors seem brighter.///[thinking]Can it be? Is the Wildwood healed at long last? It has been steeped in corruption and darkness for far too long.,"[thinking]We all believe in you, #player_name#. We are all lending our best wishes for you.

Why is this so hard for me?","[neutral]I'm honestly most talkative at night. It's weird how that works. Is that normal, #player_name#?","[happy]It's nice having someone come by to check up on me. You're a very thoughtful cat, #player_name#.",[neutral]#npc_name_coco# says I need to have more self-confidence. I don't even know what that means.,"[happy]I actually really like hunting. I'm pretty good at it too!///[shocked]Sorry, I didn't mean to brag.","[thinking]Thank you for taking the time to talk to me. Sorry I'm not always super talkative back. I do appreciate it, I promise.","[sad]I think I'll be going now. ...See you later, #player_name#...","[blushing]Oh goodness, I just figured out how to talk normal around you and now there's a new layer of embarrassment because we're dating.///[angry]Why isn't this as difficult for you as it is for me?",[happy]I like spending time with you. That's a rarity. That's how I know I like you.,[thinking]We don't have to talk. We can just spend time together. Maybe we can go hunting for bugs in the forest instead.,"[blushing]#npc_name_coco# was just asking me about you. I didn't know what to say, I'm not used to cats approaching me. It always spikes my anxiety.","[playful]How do you know that you like a cat? I once heard it said that you'll know when your heart is beating faster in your chest when the other cat is around.///[shocked]But my heart is always beating faster in my chest when anybody comes close, so how can I be sure?",[happy]I'm so happy you saw past my shyness and gave me a chance. I know I'm not the most approachable of cats.///[shocked]I usually get spooked and run away when I don't recognize someone.,[sad]Am I doing OK? I don't really know how to be in a relationship to be frank.///[shocked]I'm worried I'm going to let you down!,[neutral]You sure you meant for me to have that [green]Red Rose[/green]? Surely you've thought about it since then. Am I really your first choice?///[playful]That makes me feel nice and warm inside.,[happy]I didn't realize I was so affectionate. Guess I never really had an outlet for it before. Sorry if I keep tickling you with my tail.,"[thinking]I feel so awkward! Everybody knows we're in a relationship now, #player_name#. And they won't shut up about it!///[sad]What if I say something wrong or do something that makes you not like me any more?","[blushing]Sorry, I can't stop blushing when I see you! It makes me nervous for some reason.","[thinking]I get so lost in my own thoughts sometimes. I try to think three steps ahead and it usually comes back to bite me.///[neutral]I'm trying to live in the moment, day to day. Today is good, because I'm with you.","[shocked]Say, if a [green]Snake[/green] ever sneaks into my den, you'd deal with it right?///[happy]Now that I've got you to do my dirty work, I don't have to worry about all the what-ifs!",[happy][purr]I'm glad to see you so happy. It makes me happy. It's like a cycle of happiness.,[playful]I might have snuck into your den and grabbed something. But I'll never tell you what! You'll have to guess.///[happy]Surprises are romantic anyways!,"[happy]With you by my side, I don't really have to worry about losing my home or getting beat up. I've got you to protect me.","[thinking]My den is a bit small. Isn't yours more comfy?///[shocked]Oh, I crossed the line! I'm sorry! It won't happen again.","[neutral]I'm starting to think more positively about myself, and I think that's your fault.///[happy]At least with me around, you won't have to worry about going hungry!","[playful]I'm glad I moved out here. I wasn't so sure about it at first. New experiences scare me, if you couldn't tell.///[happy]But if I hadn't moved I wouldn't have met you, #player_name#! So it was definitely worth it.","[blushing]Do you ever think about how life could be so different if you had made different choices along the way? I couldn't sleep last night, that thought was keeping me up.///[thinking]It's scary not knowing what the future holds.",[sad]...I think I really screwed up. I'm so bad at all of this.,"[playful]Phew, I'm glad the wedding is over. I hated being in front of all those cats. It's a lot of pressure!///[happy]I just wanted to get it over with and be married to you, #player_name#. Now I have what I want and I'm content.",[happy]I'm going to try to snag us some dinner. I smelled a whole family of [green]Voles[/green] when I was walking the other day. Hopefully they're still out there.,"[thinking]We are total opposites, don't you think?///You're super social and have a ton of responsibilities. I'm timid and would hate to be in charge. I think that's why we work so well together, #player_name#.","[happy]I didn't know if marriage was right for me. I didn't think any cat would ever want to get to know me enough to actually strike up a relationship, let alone propose.///[shocked]It's all so confusing! I'm glad it happened though.","[blushing]Anything I can help you with today, #player_name#?///[shocked]Except for fighting, of course! I can hold my own, but it really frightens me. Anything other than that is what I meant.","[blushing]I don't always need to talk. I enjoy just hanging out. If you've got something on your mind I'll listen, but I'm content to spend some time together.",[shocked]Sorry about last night! I think I pushed you out of the bed. Or maybe that was a dream. I don't really know.,[happy]It's surprising how much more fun everything is when you've got someone to do it with. Even hunting is better when we're together!,"[neutral]So few cats even bother to get to know me. Which is understandable, because I don't get to know them either. I'm probably the worst cat to talk to, I don't have the skillset for conversing.///[happy]I used to think that was a major flaw. Then you showed up. Seems like it was alright after all.///[playful]I'm starting to understand that's just how I am and I should be more comfortable with it.",[playful]I want to hear a story about your day! You seemed so busy yesterday that surely something exciting happened. Anything worth mentioning?,"[playful]Sorry if I startled you last night. I have a bad habit of walking around super quietly. I think it came about because I would try to avoid talking to cats, so I didn't want them to notice me.///[shocked]I had to get up to get a drink in the middle of the night. I couldn't tell if you saw me come back in or not.","[sad]I didn't sleep at all last night. There was a noise outside the den that I didn't like. I sleep pretty lightly anyways.///[thinking]If it happens again, should I wake you up to investigate or would you rather keep sleeping?","[neutral]Oh, #player_name#, you've got a twig caught in your fur. Let me get that for you.///[happy]There we go, all better!","[happy]Your tongue is super scratchy! I don't mean it as an insult, it's really good at getting stuff out of my fur. Just a random observation.","[neutral]Must've been hard work getting to know me. I'm not exactly an open book.///[happy]You were so persistent. Stopping by every day it felt like. At first I didn't like it. Not one bit!///[playful]But then I got used to it and I realized I liked you. It's embarrassing how quickly I started to develop feelings for you.///[shocked]I don't know if you realized it or not! It's pretty embarrassing, isn't it? I'm done talking about it.","[happy][purr]Got much to do today, or do you want to hang out? We could go climb a tree or something. I've always wanted to try that.","[playful]You're so hard-working! If you ever want to take a break and get a quick nap in with me, just let me know. I usually sleep a bit around noon so that I'm ready to stay up late.",[thinking]I still feel like you're too good for me. I don't know why I can't shake the feeling.,"[happy][purr]You got really warm last night, so I curled up next to you and held your paw.///[shocked]I hope I didn't wake you up!","[blushing][purr]Thanks for everything you do for me, #player_name#. It's not difficult to feel your love for me. You work so hard to support our family!","[shocked]Hey, you've got a really big family now, huh? Four kittens! Imagine that!///[playful]I wouldn't know where to start. That's why you're #leader_title_with_article# and I'm just #npc_name_buttercup#.","[shocked]Is it true that you've lived out here for more than two full years? That's so long! I can't even think more than a day in front of me most of the time.///[shocked]So I guess it must really be pretty safe here, huh? If you could survive that long, maybe I can too?","[shocked]Yikes! You scared me! You can't sneak up on a cat in their own den like that.///[sad]I almost ran and hid behind the table!///[thinking]Sorry #player_name#, I think I overreacted. I'm just not used to having cats over at such a weird time. I was just about to turn in for bed.","[sad]I like coming to the store, but I don't like it when #npc_name_spark# is here. They like to hide behind the merchandise and jump out and scare me. It's not nice!///[shocked]Maybe I'll come back later...","[shocked]Oh, I never know what to buy! There's way too many options! Why does this always happen to me?///[thinking]I'll probably leave empty-handed as usual... I can never make up my mind.","[shocked]Oh no, is that #npc_name_krampy# I see over there? I need to go and hide before they see me!!///[sad]Why does every cat like to pick on me? I wish they would just leave me alone...","[shocked]I'm not great at making friends. I was pretty lonely when I first moved here, living in my small den all by myself...///[happy]Married life is much better for me. #npc_name_bob# brings such a loving energy into our home. You can really feel it.",[blushing]I'm so excited! #npc_name_bob# is going to go fishing later and bring back some [green]Minnows[/green]. That's our favorite family meal!,"[neutral]I still stay up late, but I have to be quiet and tip-toe around the den or else I'll wake #npc_name_bob# up.///[playful]Our sleep schedules are pretty different!","[neutral]I've known a lot of cute kittens in my life, but I'm pretty sure that mine are the cutest!///[happy]I see so much of #npc_name_bob# in each and every one of them.

I'm sure you understand what a privilege that is.","[blushing]I don't ever waste my time. If something isn't worth doing, I don't do it. That's why you should feel good about the fact that we're taking the time to get to know each other.///[happy]I know you're the same way, and I appreciate it. Most cats wouldn't even get it if I told them that, but I know you do.","[neutral]You're an early riser too, huh #player_name#? Good. All the best cats are. You've got to hit it hard as early as you can if you want to have a productive day.",[playful]There's no replacement for hard work. I try to get up before the sun rises every single day. You'd be surprised how much you can get done with an extra hour or three in your schedule.,[shocked]Can you believe how many cats waste their mornings by sleeping in? Laziness is a hard habit to break. You can't let yourself slip up even once or it'll creep up on you too.,"[playful]Oh, you're surprised I'm still awake? Long hours are necessary if you want to be as successful as me. You've got to maximize every opportunity. When everyone else is asleep, you can really get ahead.","[playful]Another long night! It's a blessing in disguise. If you put in the hours, you're bound to find success. Take it from me, I'd know a thing or two about that.",[angry]What? You think you're going to catch me dozing off because it's late?///[playful]I would never! My discipline is rock-solid.,[neutral]You look like you're planning on lounging about in the sun. Bad idea! That's a good way to waste an entire day.///[playful]Those who rise to the top are those who are constantly on the move. You have to cultivate an attitude of persistence if you want to win the prize.,[thinking]This weather is perfect for planning on ambush. I'm going to sneak around near the borders for a while and hope I can catch someone off guard.///[neutral]You've got to use everything life throws at you to your advantage. That's what separates the winners from the losers.,"[playful]Rain's good for something. It hides your scent and muffles your sounds.///[thinking]Of course, that works in reverse, too. Keep your wits about you and you won't fall victim to the schemes of smarter cats.",[shocked]How much longer are we going to have to deal with this snow? It gets your paws all wet when you head into the den for the night. I couldn't sleep last night on account of the chill in the air.,"[playful]I'm not at all concerned about the weather! Cower inside if you must, but I've got work to do today and nothing is going to get in my way.",[happy]It's good to spend time in harsh conditions like a blizzard. It toughens you up and raises your threshold for discomfort. That's a skill that's worth cultivating.,"[shocked]Hey #player_name#, looks like you're a little rough around the edges. You lose a fight to a [green]Shrew[/green], or what?///[thinking]Mind you, I've seen worse. I'm sure you'll be fine.","[playful]I've been watching you run about all day. You must be tired from all that hard work. I'd share something with you, but I think hunger's a good motivator. Sharpens the mind, kicks you into gear.","[angry]I don't know how you get under my skin so quickly, but you've managed to find a way. What could you possibly want?","[thinking]I'm busy practicing. I can't really talk for long. If I sacrifice my whole day just to talk to you, I'll never get anything done.","[neutral]You here to hang with the cool cats? Maybe some of it will rub off on you. Who knows?///[playful]After all, you probably need it. So I'll humor you for a bit. Say, next time bring me some [green]Foxglove[/green] and I'll probably be happier to see you.","[playful]I've never lost a battle. I never will. I am too tough.///[thinking]I may be young, but I've seen a thing or two. I can handle pretty much anything.","[neutral]There's a festival coming up. I've been training all season for it.///[playful]If you thought you had a chance at taking home some [red]Festival Tokens[/red], think again! You're going to be up against some pretty tough competition.","[playful]There's two kinds of cats: winners and losers. You can guess which one I am. Which one are you, I wonder?///[thinking]I don't like to come to conclusions quickly, but cats have to earn my respect.","[playful]#npc_name_spark# keeps asking me to race. Why would I? I already know that I'd win.///[neutral]No reason to crush their dreams. Besides, I have way more important things to do with my time.","[neutral]A lot of cats focus too much on brains and not enough on brawn. Doesn't matter how smart you are when you get pinned down.///[thinking]What matters then is brute force. Who is stronger, you or me? That determines the outcome.///[neutral]That's why you can't cut corners with your training! Got to stay on top of your game if you want to come out ahead.","[playful]Who taught you to fight, #player_name#? You fight like a kitten. No offense, but you've got a ways to go. Someone's got to tell you.","[neutral]You look a little scrawny. I could help you out with that if you would like.///[happy]Trust me, you need it. You've got to be tough if you want to survive out here.///[playful]Follow my lead and you won't be [green]Weasel[/green]-food anytime soon!",[thinking]I keep a pile of heavy rocks around so I can train with them. You wouldn't believe the gains you can get from picking up and chucking a couple big rocks every day.///[neutral]I need to head down to the river and find some more. That's where the best rocks come from.,[shocked]Can you believe the nerve of some cats? #npc_name_spark# keeps giving me a nasty look every time I walk by.///[angry]It's disrespectful! After all the amazing things I've done on behalf of #colony_title_with_article#. Don't they know greatness when they see it??,[playful]I should talk to you more about the art of fighting. You probably don't have a good handle on it. I can tell from your soft paws and stiff joints.///[neutral]I can't get enough of it. I live for the fray!,"[neutral]You know, behind that serious face, #npc_name_coco#'s not nearly as tough as they look.///[thinking]When I first arrived, they were so stern and solemn with me.///[happy]I think it's all an act. Some cats put on a show so that you'll assume they're in charge. It works on most cats, but not me. You've got to earn my respect! No shortcuts allowed.","[neutral]There's nothing more important in life than winning. Everything's a competition, #player_name#. Absolutely everything.///[thinking]You want social standing? You've got to fight for it. You want to eat? Best be ready to compete with the best hunters around. You looking to get rich? Step up your game, everybody else wants a piece of that too.///[neutral]Stay on your toes and be alert to the challenges around you so they won't catch you off guard.","[angry]The more difficult a fight is, the bigger the pay off. No risk, no reward.///[playful]And I'm not talking about the trophies. I'm talking about the satisfaction of a job well done. Can't beat it!","[neutral]I once heard that fear is a good motivator. Do you think that's true, #player_name#?///[shocked]I have to ask some other cat, because I can't test it for myself. I'm never afraid of anything!","[happy]You wanna hear the best advice I ever received? Of course you do, that's why you keep coming back to talk to me.///[neutral]Never give up, and never quit. Persistence is the key to success!///[happy]It's such a simple thought, but if you live your life guided by that principle, you can do anything you set your mind to.","[neutral]I'm not taking a break! I know it might look like it, but I assure you I'm not doing anything that isn't absolutely necessary.///[happy]After a big workout, you have to give your muscles some time to heal up. Otherwise you'll run yourself into the ground. So I'm using this time to get some chores off my list.///[shocked]I wish I were out there, gallantly defending our borders! Maybe with some more training, my capacity will increase and I'll be able to spend more time doing the things that I love.","[thinking]It took some time, but you finally proved yourself to me. I don't give out respect lightly, but I think you've earned it, #player_name#.///[happy]That's the highest compliment a cat can receive!","[playful]If you catch wind of a fight going down on the borders, you better not scurry off without first inviting me along. I would be devastated to miss out.///[happy]Plus, you'll need someone to protect you from the wiles of our endless enemies! I am quite capable of providing that service.","[angry]What?? Can't I spend one minute alone, without you nagging me? Find something else to do.","[happy]You want to hear about my day? It's been very productive. Caught a [green]Mouse[/green] or two, then I went to survey the woods for signs of danger.///[shocked]Sadly I have nothing to report on that front. I was hoping to bump into a quick skirmish, but there's always tomorrow.","[thinking]I saw a plump #item_name_robin# out in the field and I thought of you. How strange.///[shocked]I must have gotten lost in my thoughts, because before I was able to pounce, it must have caught my scent and flew away. It won't happen again!",[neutral]It's very healthy to spend time around other talented cats. We can hone each other's skills and both be made better for it.///[happy]That's why this relationship was such a good idea. Not every cat has determination like you and I.,"[playful]I know that you were the one to give me the #item_name_red_rose#, but I already had in mind to ask you out before you came to me. So in a way, our relationship was actually my idea.///[neutral]Either way, it's nice. We don't have to agree on how it all started. The important thing is that it's happening now.","[playful]I'm a planner. I like to make lots of plans. Six-month plans, five-year plans, ten-year plans. It's like a map of where your life is going to go.///[shocked]If you don't set your heading early, you'll never get to where you want to go. It's a fact. You can't stumble through life!","[neutral]#leader_title_capitalized#? It's just a word. What matters more is your actions.///[playful]In my opinion, you are worthy of that title. But status like that is something you have to earn again every single day.///[thinking]Keep your nose to the grindstone and cats will keep respecting you. I know I do.",[playful]Every cat should ensure that they are always presenting themselves in the best-possible light. I spent longer than usual this morning styling on my fur.///[blushing]...Do you like it? I thought I'd try something new to surprise you.,"[happy]Whenever I see you coming my way, my blood starts pumping and I get really giddy. It's the same feeling as when you finally catch a juicy piece of prey. Weird, huh?","[thinking]My parents were very demanding. They required nothing but the best out of me. Even though they aren't around any more, I still feel the pressure to meet my full potential.///[neutral]If you're going to stick around, that's something you'll have to be OK with. I don't think I'll ever be able to change that part of me.///[shocked]Not that I'd even want to change it! It's what's made me so successful. I honor my parents by continuing to live out what they wanted for me.","[happy]Hey, have you already worked out today? If you could use a squatting partner, I'm your cat. Daily training is important to maintaining your health.///[thinking]I took it easy once, gave myself a month off. I lost so much muscle that month that I swore I'd never do it again!","[neutral]I can tell what you're thinking. It's one of my many natural talents. Let me get a good read on you.///[playful]You're happy to see me. I can see it all over your face! You can't hide your feelings from me, #player_name#. I've studied you far too long for that.///[blushing]Lucky for you, the feeling is mutual.","[neutral]Say, if you have the chance, I could really use a snack tomorrow after my workout. I don't have anything lined up, but ideally it would be high in protein. That's how you build muscle and stay on top of your game.///[playful]You can't win fights if you aren't at least as strong as the other guy. I learned that lesson the hard way on more than one occasion.","[blushing]You've got something in your fur, #player_name#. Here, let me get it, it will only take a second...///[playful]There we go! All better. Just a little bit of fuzz.///[neutral]Sorry if that was nitpicky. I was told that I can be fussy about that sort of thing.","[happy]I saw you hunting the other day. There was a technique you used when you pounced, it looked like a little wiggle. Does that really help?///[playful]You've got to teach me how to do that! Maybe it helps you balance better or something. It certainly seems to work for you, so maybe it'll work for me?",[neutral]Guess what? There's one less family of [green]Rats[/green] running about in the woods as of today. #npc_name_champ# put a stop to their villainy.///[happy]I'm very proud of myself for that one. I'll have to give you the full story later.,"[blushing]Oh, me? No, I'm not blushing!///[angry]Why do you have to tease me like that? It's so embarrassing!","[blushing]I really admire how you take initiative. You have an excellent sense of responsibility for your own life.///[neutral]I've learned that if you want something to change, you have to take it upon yourself to change it. That's an amazing quality to have.","[happy]You don't have to worry about anything, #player_name#. You've got me to protect you!///[neutral]I won't let #colony_title_with_article# down. More importantly, I won't let you down. I give you my word.","[playful]You're pretty tough, you know. I'll bet you can handle anything the world throws at you. I love that.///[happy]I know it's true because you handle me alright! I know I can be a handful.","[playful]Hey, I know I tease you a lot, but I wanted to make sure you knew that it's because I know you can handle it. If it ever gets to be too much, you let me know and I'll back off.",[angry]I used to think I was invincible. That I could deal with anything. Now I'm not so sure...,"[thinking]If I'm ever too harsh on you, I want you to know that I'm doing it out of love. I know you'll call me out when I'm not living up to my full potential, and I want to extend the same courtesy to you.///[happy]That's what being a good partner is all about! You've got my back, and I've got yours. We'll keep each other accountable to keep improving, OK?","[happy]When I lived alone, I found it easier to justify sleeping in. Now that you're around, I know I've got to get up and get going. You deserve nothing but the best, #player_name#.","[neutral]Do you mind if I turn the back corner of the den into a workout area? I need somewhere to do my training in the morning.///[happy]Being healthy is good for you, but it sure can take up a lot of space if you do it right!","[thinking]I never really knew what sacrifice was until you came along. You really tore down my walls with your constant, selfless generosity. It's a very attractive quality.///[happy]If I'm going to learn to be the best cat that I can be, I can't think of a better mentor than you, #player_name#.","[playful]I went for a late-night run last night. I hope I didn't wake you up when I left. Sometimes you've got to get moving in order to process your thoughts.///[shocked]Plus, I get so cooped up sometimes! I have to get out in the fresh air.","[playful]Maybe later we can have a wrestling match. I've got a couple new moves to teach you, and the practice is always welcomed.///[happy]And don't go easy on me just because we're married! I can see right through that. There's no shame in winning, but there's something to be ashamed of if you intentionally hold yourself back.","[happy]You've gotten a lot stronger since the first time we met. I'd like to think that's my positive influence on your habits, but I know there's more to it than that.///[neutral]I'm very proud of you, #player_name#. I hope you feel the same way about me.","[thinking]Can you grab something to eat before you come home? I've got a busy day ahead. Plenty of battles to be won. You know how it is.///[neutral]I think I saw a [green]Crab[/green] scurrying about, too. I might track it down and have a little fun batting it around.","[thinking]You know that feel you get in the pit of your stomach right before a big challenge? Whether it's a fight or a hard conversation, it's a distinct feeling.///[shocked]It's like you can feel the weight of everyone who's counting on you and you know that you have to do your best, but things could go either way.///[happy]Then, when you finally tackle the trial and come out the other side victorious, you get that rush of satisfaction. You know what I mean, don't you #player_name#?///[blushing]I get that feeling when you're around. Isn't that strange?",[happy]I could run a thousand laps around #colony_title_with_article# today! Nothing can stop me.///[neutral]Life is going so well lately that I don't know what to make of it. I wake up happy every single day. Happier than I have been for a long time.,"[neutral]There's lots of cats I respect. I could give you a whole list. Of course, you're on that list, #player_name#. You're #leader_title_with_article#, for crying out loud.///[happy]It's important that you let others know when they've impacted your life in a positive way. Verbal affirmation is one of the best ways to let them know that you're proud of them and that they're doing the right thing.///[thinking]We all need that from time to time. A reminder that what we're doing matters and that other cats are counting on us.","[happy]You know, relationships are similar to anything else. They require constant work, fine-tuning, and maintenance in order to continue functioning properly.///[happy]Fortunately you make that easy, #player_name#. I'm very lucky to have a cat like you in my life.","[thinking]I've never been the biggest cat around. I've had to work super hard for everything I've achieved. I'm not naturally a strong cat because I'm smaller than many of the others, but I spent years working on myself until I became self-sufficient.///[neutral]I think that caused me to develop a strange sort of complex where I felt I was better than everybody else because I put in the work when they weren't willing to do so. It's not a very healthy way to view the world, I now realize.///[happy]Does that make any sense? I'm probably just rambling. You can ignore it, #player_name#.","[playful]We've accomplished so much together, #player_name#. From building and protecting a thriving #colony_title#, to forging an amazing friendship that turned into a spectacular marriage, and more.///[shocked]But there's more to be done! I have big plans for our future. I know you do too. In a way, we're both along for the ride.///[happy]I wouldn't have it any other way.","[happy]#colony_full_name_capitalized_with_article# is very fortunate to have you at the helm, #player_name#. I don't think there's a more capable cat out there today than you.///[playful]With the possible exception of myself, of course. But I've never been one for leadership. I'm more interested in being the best I can be. You're more interested in helping others be the best that they can be. It's one of your finest qualities.","[shocked]It's been one of those days. I have such a clear vision of the cat that I want to be, but things just aren't coming together like I want them too.///[sad]It's frustrating to have your eyes set on a goal and feel like it's constantly out of reach.///[neutral]I have you by my side, though, and it's hard for me to be frustrated when you're near. Having a loving partner can really help put things into perspective.///[happy]Thanks, #player_name#.","[blushing]There's a lot of things that are worth doing. One of those is working out and staying healthy. Another one is strengthening a relationship.///[happy]I'm making an effort to do the latter as much as I do the former. I really love you, #player_name#, and I want you to always feel appreciated and respected.",[happy]Did you do something new with your hair? It looks good. Maybe you can teach me how to style mine that way.,"[playful]You smell good. Been snacking a bit before you came my way? Or maybe you found a tasty clump of [green]Catnip[/green]? Either way, it's making me drool!","[happy]Wow, there's not a lot of things that can sweep me off my feet, but you found the secret. As usual, you look amazing today, #player_name#.///[neutral]I know how much effort you put towards presenting yourself well and looking good. I appreciate it. I'm a very lucky cat, you know.","[playful]I've seen your kid running around town. What's their name again... #npc_name_kittenone#? Yeah, that's it.///[happy]That kitten's got more energy than a [green]Weasel[/green] on [green]Catnip[/green]. You better watch yourself around them! Bet they'll grow up to be an excellent fighter.","[playful]Hey now, #player_name#, word on the street is that you've been training hard lately. Got any new skills to demonstrate for me?///[thinking]Just be careful not to go too hard or else I might have to consider you as a rival. You wouldn't want that, huh?///[playful]No one can best #npc_name_champ#!","[neutral]Rise and grind, am I right #player_name#? I always took you for the type of cat to get up early and hit the weights. C'mon, I need a spotter for my next set.","[neutral]You think it's easy to wake up this early and work on my muscles? Let me let you in on a secret.///[playful]It's not easy, even for me. It never has been and it never will. Easy tasks just aren't worth doing, #player_name#.///[neutral]That's why I keep my nose down and put in the work every morning. Trust me, it all pays off.","[neutral]Do you come to the Temple often, #player_name#? I guess you must given your job.///[happy]I figured I'd come to pay my respects and wish for strength in the days to come. Every little bit helps, don't you think?","[angry]I thought for sure I heard one of those nasty voidling cats prowling around here. Don't worry #player_name#, if it shows its ugly mug #npc_name_champ# will be on the case.///[shocked]It can't hide from my claws!","[thinking]I have the strongest relationship in #colony_title_with_article#. #npc_name_elli# and I are pretty awesome together, aren't we?","[neutral]Marriage is hard work. Just like everything in life, #player_name#.///[playful]You have to know what you want and go for it.///[shocked]Yes, technically #npc_name_elli# did ask [b]me[/b] to marry [b]them[/b], but that is because I had already put effort into our relationship.///[thinking]If you work hard, #player_name#, someday you might have a marriage as strong as mine.","[playful]Hey, #player_name#, I can't hang out today. I still need to catch some prey to take home.///[blushing]I've got to take care of my family. It's the most important thing.",[happy]I'm pumped today! You know why?///[playful]Because #npc_name_aster# just beat me in a footrace!

I'll take it.","[neutral]Weird gift, but OK.","[shocked]Hey, get that thing away from me!","[angry]Wow. I see how it is. That's totally uncalled for, #player_name#.",[happy]You really went out of your way to get me one of these for my [rainbow]birthday[/rainbow]? Cool. That's the best gift I've gotten all day.,"[playful]I think I can make use of that. Thanks, #player_name#.","[neutral]For my [rainbow]birthday[/rainbow], I assume.","[angry]Wow, cool. I'll definitely not throw it away as soon as you leave.

It's not a good look.,"[neutral]You want a #gift_item#? I have like a thousand of them. Seriously, they're starting to get in my way. Take it.","[neutral]Somebody told me it's your [rainbow]birthday[/rainbow]. Parties are lame, but I got you this #gift_item# if you want it.///[thinking]It's really no big deal. I had it lying around. Thought maybe you would enjoy it more than me.",[thinking]It's always the same old story. Everybody hates me. I get it.///[angry]I've grown used to it by now.

I'm not going to say it wouldn't be fun sneaking around like that.///But nah, then I'd have to be with you, and it's not really worth it. Sorry.","[playful]I don't really go for jewelry. Tacky, if you ask me. Besides, I assume #player_spouse_name# would probably try to kill me if I took it from you.","[shocked]Oh boy, I sure can't wait to settle down and be boring for the rest of my life!///[thinking]Yeah, commitment's not really my style. I think I need a lot more time to think it over, #player_name#.","[neutral]It's nice of you and all, but I only need the one. I'm not very good with plants. Too much of a hassle.","[blushing]Alright, alright. I guess it's time to level with you. I might... kinda sorta have a crush on you too.///[shocked]Hey, don't make fun of me!

But if the offer still stands and you're down for something weird, then I guess I'm your cat.///[happy]Let's see what happens.","[thinking]You're fun and all, and I like hanging around you, but the idea of being stuck together forever still kinda scares me. Let's just keep things where they're at for now.","[neutral]Tacky, but it reminds me of you. Honestly it's a mixed bag seeing another one of these. You should probably go throw it in the woods somewhere or toss it in the sea. I really only need the one.","[thinking]When we started our relationship thing, I didn't know what to think about you. I also had no clue what a relationship meant.///[blushing]We've had a lot of fun together, right? We both like hanging out and obviously we both care about each other a lot.///[shocked]I didn't think I'd ever be the cat to say this, but sure.

I've got stuff to do and you're kinda holding me back. So... yeah. Let's never speak to each other ever again, OK?","[sad]This is really not working out. It's probably my fault, I know I'm a weird cat.

It's unhealthy what's been going on between the two of us, and I think I could do a whole lot better on my own.///[thinking]So... bye, I guess. I don't know how to end something like this.","[playful]Yeah, I guess I will. That works for me.","[playful]I prepared a speech and everything but I won't say it 'cause I know you'd get all embarrassed. I'll save it for later.///[happy]Alright, now we're married, so what is everyone still standing around for? Somebody start the party! We're all here to have a good time, aren't we?","[playful]Why are weddings always so stuffy? Every one I've been too has been so rigid and formal. Gross. Not my cup of tea.///[happy]What do you say we get out of here as soon as possible? It's our wedding, nobody could stop us. We're married now anyways so what does it matter?","[neutral]Hey, that was cool. Nice little dinner and a show.///[thinking]If you're here to chastise me for walking in late, save your breath. I really don't care, I'm just here for a good time. As soon as things start to get boring I'm out!","[playful]Never really knew what to do with you when you were a kitten, but now that you're an adult I'm starting to figure it out. You grew up to be pretty cool, #player_name#.","[neutral]You're #player_name#? Huh. Thought you'd be taller or something. Not quite what I had in mind.///[thinking]I'm #npc_name_charlotte#. We probably won't see each other around much. I like being alone most of the time.///Anyways, I've got a lot of stuff to do, so... yeah.",[happy]I'm in a good mood today. I can do whatever I want.,[neutral]Hey. Heard you were old now. It's on the calendar.,[neutral]I'm here for the food. You know where I can get some?,[neutral]I was so bored I actually signed up for the games this year. Let's hope this isn't as lame as I assume it is.,"[angry]You really want to get yelled at, don't you? What a loser.",[neutral]Hey. What are you looking at?,"[thinking]Oh look, it's #player_name#, here to talk my ear off again. What's up?","[neutral]Need something? You've got an eager look on your face, #player_name#.",[thinking]Hey. What's new with you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[sad]Oh. It's #player_name#. What a joy.,[neutral]Doesn't really feel like much has changed between us. That's good. I was worried it would get awkward.,"[playful]You always have something to say, don't you #player_name#? Got any good stories?","[happy]You know, we don't always have to talk. Sometimes we can just hang out in the same space.",[blushing]Can we spend some time together today? Unless you're busy. I don't want to impose.,"[angry]Isn't this grand? You and me against the world. And also, you against me. Pretty much everything is against me.","[playful]You coming to give me a kiss? You're kind of a dork, #player_name#.","[neutral]I'm still getting adjusted to this marriage thing. What a weird concept. All I care about is that I get to live with you and wake up next to you. That's neat, huh?","[happy]I'm not good with words, you know. But you also know that I love you, right?",[playful]Want to cuddle? I could use a good cuddle session.,"[neutral]Seriously, I saw it posted on the calendar, so don't mention it. I'm terrible with dates. Don't think too highly of me, #player_name#.","[happy]You can push cats out of the way and treat them rudely as long as they know its your [rainbow]birthday[/rainbow]. They tend to cut you a little slack.///[thinking]Besides, if you just had some [green]Catnip[/green], everybody knows to steer clear. Now watch out, #player_name#! You're in my zone!","[neutral]I've got a plan. I'm going to gather up a bunch of those colorful flowers and twist them into a crown and wear it on my head. I think it's festive and fun.///[thinking]I have to wait until #npc_name_coco# turns their back, though. They spent a lot of time on those flowers. Think I'd get in trouble for picking them?","[playful]You're really going wild, #player_name#. I've been watching you run all around the plaza. I know you're #leader_title_with_article# and all, but come on! Cut loose and relax a bit, it's a festival!///[happy]Besides, I heard you've got a hot date today! Heh.","[thinking]I've got pollen in my nose. Gross.///[playful]Better watch out, #player_name#, or I'll sneeze on you! Better start running, heh!","[neutral]It's too warm for this. My paws are burning on the bricks.///[thinking]Hey, you're a powerful cat, #player_name#. Why don't you make it less hot out, huh?","[neutral]I'm really only here to make fun of everybody else. There's something about festival days that brings out the goofy in cats.///[thinking]Not to embarrass you or whatever, but you do some stupid stuff too when it's festival day. It makes me laugh.///[playful]I'm watching you, #player_name#!","[happy]Did you bring anything to eat, #player_name#? I forgot to have breakfast this morning. Too excited about the party.///[playful]Now where are the cool cats hanging around?","[neutral]Quick, hide the party! #player_name# is here to break it up!///[playful]...I'm just messing with you, #player_name#.///[thinking]Or am I?",[thinking]Wonder what would happen if you chugged five [green]Glow Potions[/green] at the same time? If I get enough [red]Festival Tokens[/red] I'm going to give it a try.,"[happy]Hey, you've got some leaves stuck in your fur! Cool, #player_name#.///[thinking]I'm going to find some to tuck under my collar. I think you might have started a trend. There's a first time for everything, right?","[neutral]Well, I'm freezing my paws off and miserable. Cool party. Thanks for putting this on. I'll have to share my thoughts with #npc_name_coco# too.///[neutral]I guess I'll stick around though. Nothing better to do around here.","[neutral]Usually when it snows, I make it a point to stay inside like a sane cat.///[thinking]I can't miss a party, though. That would be really lame. So here I am.///[neutral]Oh, and I guess I want to support you or something like that. Yeah.","[happy]After the festival, you wanna head out to the lake and slide around on the ice? It's getting pretty thin so it's our last chance.///[playful]I've heard it's dangerous. That just makes it more exciting!","[thinking]There's like, [green]ladybugs[/green] everywhere. I'm trying to avoid them landing on me.///[neutral]I don't like feeling them crawl around in my fur. It's grossing me out just thinking about it.","[neutral]The leaves are changing and going back to normal. They were way too colorful for way too long. It makes me angry.///[thinking]If everything in the world were monochrome and neutral, I'd be a lot happier.","[neutral]You don't always have to be doing stuff, you know. You could take a day off and lounge about like us normal cats.///[thinking]What, you think you're special just because you're #leader_title_with_article#? Nah. Every cat likes to spend a summer day soaking in the warmth and doing nothing.///[neutral]Don't try to convince me otherwise.","[thinking]When it's warm, I take a lot of walks. I like my own company. Myself and I have a great relationship.","[shocked]Woah, it got cold out! That explains why all the grass is dying. Is it really autumn already? It always sneaks up on me.","[neutral]Hey, if it's all the same to you, I'm busy. I've got to stock up some food before winter hits. The prey is already getting harder to find. Pretty soon it'll all be dead or hibernating.","[angry]There's no prey, there's no herbs to pick... What's winter good for, anyways?///[thinking]I know you can't do anything about it, but I've got to rant to somebody. It sucks. Why do we even need this stupid season anyways?",[neutral]I heard there's a party or something coming up at the end of the season. I'll just assume I'm on the guest list. I can't imagine you wouldn't want me to show up.,"This is #npc_name_charlotte#'s den. If you want to walk away unharmed, it's best you move away from the door until you get to know them better.///#npc_name_charlotte# has decorated the doorway with strange flowers that you don't recognize. They look poisonous. Yikes!","[angry]Hey, don't go poking around too much! I have a lot of private, off-limits stuff laying about. Nothing I'd want you to get your grubby paws on.","[shocked]Did you wipe your paws at the door? No? Then go back and do it first.///[neutral]My house, my rules!","[angry]No no, just make yourself at home! Why don't you just invite yourself in, #player_name#? Let me serve you snacks and we can sit and have a civil discussion like this is normal behavior!",[shocked]I kinda thought this was my personal space. You can't just barge in here and expect me to be happy to have you as a guest. I didn't even have time to clean.,"[angry]You really think you can invite yourself into any cat's house at any time and receive a warm welcome? Think again, #player_name#.///[thinking]I need my own space and some time alone. Sheesh. If I wanted to talk, I'd be out in public talking.","[neutral]Hey, you probably know this about me by now, but I feel like I should verbalize it. I'm not a very good host, so don't expect five-star service or anything like that.///[neutral]I like to keep things pretty casual when I'm at home. I didn't even pick up, so please don't touch anything.","[blushing]I don't know that I want you rummaging around in my den. It kind of stresses me out just having you in here, #player_name#. Does that make sense?","[angry]You better not take anything from my storage without asking first! I worked really hard to collect all that prey. If you're hungry, you should have grabbed a meal before you came over.",[neutral]I'm not used to having anybody other than me in here.///[thinking]I really just use the den for sleeping and storing my stuff. It's nothing special. I don't see why you needed to see it so badly.,"[shocked]Hey, can you make sure you put everything back where you found it before you leave? I get super worked up if anybody moves my stuff.///[neutral]I have a system in place, and I don't want it getting messed with. Nothing personal.","[thinking]Usually I get up early because then I don't have to talk to anybody on my way out of town. You're really throwing a wrench into that plan, huh?","[neutral]You look a little sleepy. The sun's barely even up, so why are you?///[thinking]I have a weird sleep schedule so it makes sense for me. But you're an important #leader_title# or something. Shouldn't you care more about your sleep?","[shocked]Hey, I'm still waking up. I need like, at least another hour before I'm at a conversational level of consciousness. Got it?",[thinking]I couldn't sleep so I got up to take a walk. I might stay up all night instead of heading back to bed. It's nice and quiet.,"[neutral]Hey, do you scare easily? Some cats get real skittish at night. I don't know what it is, maybe the moon and the shadows are doing something sinister.///[playful]If so, watch your back!","[neutral]Oh, I'm surprised you saw me. I was trying to blend in with the scenery. My dark fur makes it easier for me to hide.///[thinking]If I really wanted to be stealthy, I should take this collar off. The contrast is what gave me away, I assume. But it's too fashionable to leave behind, so I'd rather keep it on.","[neutral]Yuck. Look at all that direct sunlight. I'm going to get sunburnt or something.///[neutral]It's time for me to find a shaded place to chill until the clouds come back. You know of any good spots, #player_name#?","[neutral]I don't think this weather is natural. It's like ghastly wisps of the undead, coming back to haunt the living. The spirits of our ancestors are keeping watch over us, #player_name#.///[thinking]Sometimes this is how it manifests. Do you ever hear voices in the fog? Now you know why.",[happy]What a gloomy day! How perfect!///[neutral]This'll put a damper on all those peppy cats that are always smiling and happy. It makes me sick.///[thinking]I'd much rather see them soggy and miserable.,"[angry]I'm getting damp and cold. But I'm not going to move. I can't let nature win.///[neutral]Sometimes you have to stick your paw in the face of fate. Remind it that you aren't a toy that it can bat around.///[neutral]I am the master of my own life! I have agency, and no amount of snow can change that!","[happy]I can't put my paw on it, but I just know that today is going to be awesome. There's something in the air, #player_name#.///[thinking]I always took storms to be a good omen. It's good to remember how powerful nature is once in a while. We're just insignificant cats, after all. Storms don't care about us.","[neutral]Wanna play chicken in the snow? You stick your paw in the deepest snowbank you can find, and try to keep it there longer than everybody else.///[neutral]One time I got frostbite. It was so cold, but I couldn't be caught losing.///[thinking]On second thought, maybe this is a bad idea.","[shocked]You look gross. Fall in a ditch, or what?///[neutral]Honestly, it's a good look on you. Makes you look a lot tougher than you really are.","[neutral]If you came to beg for food, scram. I'm not in the sharing mood. You're plenty capable of hunting your own [green]Mice[/green].///[neutral]It's like I have to do everything around here...","[angry]I thought I told you to get out of my face. You looking for a fight? I just sharpened my claws this morning, so I'm ready to go. Don't test me.","[neutral]I moved out here to get away from everything and everybody. I thought a place like the Wildwood would be quiet and lonesome, just how I like it.///[shocked]Now I've got cats like you breathing down my neck left and right. Maybe I made a mistake!","[shocked]Hey, I'm not much of a conversationalist. If you want to say something, go right ahead, but don't expect me to reply. I'm not looking to make any friends, got it?///[neutral]Besides, I don't think you'd be the type of cat I'd hang with.","[angry]See the spikes? Do they look friendly, approachable, and agreeable? Nah, I'll bet they don't.///[neutral]If you ask me, they look more like 'get away, this cat is wild and not in a good mood.' I wear them for a reason, you know.///[thinking]Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get back to staring blankly at nothing for a while.","[angry]You think I'm going to be impressed by your title? Oh wow, here comes the boss-cat, let's all fall in line and be good little cats and do everything you say!///[angry]Nah, that's not my thing. I'm nobody's puppet. I do what I want, and if you have a problem with that, then too bad.","[neutral]I'm what they call 'bad-mannered.' That's what my parents called me, anyways. They never did figure out what's wrong with me.///[angry]But I don't care! Couldn't care less about what you think. I'm just trying to live my life, and you and all the others are trying to tread all over me for it. Step off, or I'll push back.","[neutral]When I'm not standing around being moody, I like to train in my den. You can scratch pretty much anything. Gotta keep your claws sharp. Never know when you might need them in a pinch.///[playful]That's one thing I try to keep in mind. When things go south, the only cat you can rely on is yourself. So you'd best be prepared and not count on anybody to come save the day.","[neutral]Hey, you wanna know something cool? I made this collar myself. I think it suits me well. Wouldn't you agree?///[thinking]Think I had you going there for a second, you actually thought I wanted your opinion. Oh, that's sad.///[neutral]I couldn't care less what you think. I like the collar, so it stays. That's all there is to it.///[thinking]Alright, I'm done talking. Go find some other way to cure your boredom.","[thinking]I used to have a buddy that thought I was misunderstood. I disagree, I don't think I'm misunderstood at all. I think I'm genuine and authentic.///[angry]Does it rub some cats the wrong way? Yeah. All the time. So what?///[neutral]That buddy's no longer my friend because they decided they didn't like me one day. I don't let it get to me and I don't blame them. I am who I am and I'm not going to change that for anybody.///[thinking]That's why I'm usually alone. Cats don't tend to stick around very long when I'm involved. I'm over it, but I'm letting you know as a courtesy in case you were planning on trying to 'fix' me or something. Ain't happening.","[angry]I keep messing up my pounce! Why am I so stupid? I swear, the [green]Trout[/green] are laughing at me with their stupid little fish-faces.///[angry]It makes me so mad! Why can't I do anything right??","[shocked]Seems like everybody has a best friend or a tight-knit group. You know what I'm talking about?///[neutral]Maybe my brain is broken or whatever, but I don't really have that drive. It is what it is. I'm self-reliant and better off alone, I think.///[neutral]You really seem like you're trying to get to know me, #player_name#. I don't want to let you down when I don't return the favor.","[angry]Ugh, I hate my name. #npc_name_charlotte# doesn't sound tough at all. Sounds like some soft cat that likes cuddles and frolicking in the flower fields. Gross.///[neutral]But now that my parents aren't around, I'd feel awful changing it. It's like, my one reminder of them. So I've got to keep my name.","[neutral]If you're ever looking for me and you can't find me, there's a reason. My naturally dark fur makes it easier for me to hide.///[shocked]When I'm really not in the mood for company, I find a quiet bush in a dark corner of the woods and crawl inside and take a nap. It's nice to have absolutely nobody bother you for a while.","[neutral]Hey, don't get too close. I just applied some [green]Snake Lily[/green] to my paws. It's naturally poisonous, so stay back.///[playful]Makes hunting fun. All you've gotta do is nick a [green]Mouse[/green] a little bit, and the poison will do the rest of the work. You can watch the life drain from its little body, then plop! It tumbles over.///[neutral]Of course, then it's poisoned and you probably shouldn't eat it. I don't personally. Just fun to watch.","[neutral]This whole place is cursed. What the heck is up with those weird spirit-cat-things that keep attacking me? We didn't have those back home.///[angry]Hey, maybe #npc_name_theforestguardian# is doing it. I don't trust them. Weird giant glowy cat? That's not normal, and if you ask me, a little suspicious.","[shocked]Some of my [green]Foxglove[/green] stash was missing this morning. Were you sneaking around in my den, #player_name#? Give it back!!///[thinking]Eh, I know you didn't do it. You're too much of a rule-following goody-two-shoes.///[angry]I'll find the culprit, and when I do... it won't be pretty!","[neutral]Here's the trick to being happy: You've got to stop caring what other cats think. Full stop.///[thinking]You're your own cat, and you don't belong to anybody else. Be yourself and don't let anybody make you apologize for it.///[neutral]It's easy to say and harder to do. Took me long enough, but look at me now. I don't give a crap about anybody's feelings or opinions except my own.","[happy]Hey, you want to go for a swim? What, are you scared of a little water getting in your fur?///[playful][bouncy]Scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat, #player_name# is a scaredy-cat![/bouncy] I'm going to make sure everybody knows you're a coward until you get in the water!","[happy]Oh, do I smell funny? Yeah, I just had some [green]Catnip[/green]. My vision's swimming. You've got like, ten eyes right now, #player_name#!///[happy]I have the weirdest urge to jump as high as I can and do a spin. Also I'm hungry. Got any snacks?","[neutral]You've got a burr in your fur. On your back, left side, above the leg. Here, I'll get it.///[happy]There we go, all better. Stay out of the thorn-bushes, #player_name#. That could've hurt if you had laid down on it.","[thinking]Hey, what's the deal with #npc_name_ember#? Are they always so up-tight? I hate going to the store because I have to look at their stupid face. It's so fake.///[neutral]It's way better when #npc_name_spark# is working. Might not be a very capable shopkeeper, heck, they're horrible at their job, but it's refreshing to see a cat not put on a show.","[neutral]I'm basically over this dating thing. I don't know why I'm even pretending we're still together. Whatever, I'll give it another day.","[thinking]Hey, if you want to go on a little adventure, I just received a tip about a giant patch of [green]Catnip[/green] hiding in the woods. I say we track it down and eat it all on the site!","[blushing]I was honestly just going to have a chill day, hang around, watch some leaves, whatever. If you want to join, I guess you can.///[neutral]It's weird, I usually hate it when someone else is around and bothering me. I'll give you a pass for today though. No guarantees about the future.","[happy]Hey, I was following you around all day yesterday. You didn't see me, did you?///[playful]I'm pretty sneaky when I want to be. Nobody ever sees me.///[thinking]You, uh... live a pretty weird life, don't you? Most cats are content to catch a [green]Shrew[/green] and then call it a day. It was entertaining, I'll say that much. You put on a good show.","[neutral]Hey, can you scratch under my collar? It's getting itchy.///[thinking]I never take it off, so it gets irritating sometimes. But it's a part of who I am now, so I refuse to leave it behind. Heck, I sleep and bathe with it on. It's basically my actual neck at this point.///[thinking]I started wearing it when I was a much younger cat. Practically a kitten. My parents thought it was just a phase, but nope! It's me. They were dead wrong.///[neutral]I added the spikes later. They send a clear message to everybody to stay away. That's why I like it.///[thinking]You know, the clothes you wear say a lot about you. First impressions really do count, #player_name#. Think about that.","[thinking]You ever stumble across a beehive? They're always swarming with [green]Bees[/green]. Those little suckers will defend the hive with their lives.///[neutral]I heard #npc_name_krampy# talking about how bee stings can actually be good for you. I don't know, that sounds dumb. Like I'm going to intentionally let them sting me. No thank you.///[shocked]I don't trust any cat that never takes off their mask! You never know what might be hiding underneath. #npc_name_krampy# could be a dog for all we know. Doesn't that worry you?","[neutral]When we first met, you probably thought I was off-putting. Most cats do. You probably told yourself I'd warm up to you, or whatever. Most cats do.///[playful]It must have been quite a shock to learn that I'm genuine! No tough-guy front here. I'm rude to everybody, it's not a performance.///[neutral]I assume that if you had a problem with it, you would have left me alone a long time ago. But hey, if you can get over it, then I'll hang with you until you decide otherwise. Doesn't matter to me.","[neutral]Hey, you don't have to be friends with everybody, you know. You can pick and choose. You can be selective.///[angry]There's so much pressure to treat everybody nice, but it's stupid. Why should I be nice to them if they aren't going to be nice to me? Doesn't make any sense.///[neutral]You'll be a lot happier if you find your squad and stick to them. Everybody else can go make their own clique. You really don't need them.","[happy]I'm antsy today. Got loads of energy. I wanna punch somebody or something, you know? Woke up this way. I'm looking to pick a fight.///[shocked]Not with you, of course. I'd hate to beat you up like that. It wouldn't be a fair fight, after all.///[happy]If you're headed out into dangerous territory, don't forget to bring me along. Sometimes you've got to get your frustration out with your claws!","[neutral]Man, I'm going to give off such a weird energy when I'm older. I want to be that weird old cat that lives in a hut and comes out once a year and wears stupid stuff.///[thinking]If all the kittens in #colony_title_with_article# are scared of you, that's how you know you've made it.","[neutral]It's not every day you meet a cat that can put up with someone like me. I guess that makes you super weird.///[playful]I mean, I already knew you were. But you confirmed it when you gave me that [green]Red Rose[/green].","[playful]I know you've got lots of responsibilities and whatever, but I think you should forget all about them for the day. Take off work, jump in the river, get muddy.///[shocked]You spend so much time doing so much for others, you've got to take a day for yourself every once in a while! Do whatever the heck you want. I don't care what it is, only you know what you wanna do.///[playful]And I'll tag along if you'll let me.","[neutral]Controversial opinion incoming, but the point of relationships really isn't to make the other person happy. It's to make [b]you[/b] happy. And if you're not, then you're in the wrong relationship.///[shocked]It feels so simple to say it, but so many cats have that backwards. Sure, in an ideal world you're both happy, but you can't force it. You gotta look out for yourself, right?","[angry]What does 'dating' even mean, anyways? It's such a stupid label.///[thinking]Cats don't have to fit into perfect little boxes and perfect little timeframes and perfect little progression schemes for their relationships.///[shocked]Like, we are what we are. Why do we have to put words on it? It's dumb. We don't have to follow some blueprint that our grandparents' grandparents made up.","[neutral]Keep tabs on your feelings, make sure you check in with yourself daily. Love is some temporary thing, you know.///[thinking]Take my parents for example. They split up when I was really young. Did it affect me? Nah. They were right for each other, until they weren't. It was healthier that they went their separate ways, believe me.///[thinking]I'm having a good time hanging with you, by the way. No need to worry. But it might not always be that way, you know? Relationships are work.///[shocked]They're stressful and they suck sometimes. Are they worth it? I dunno. Haven't made it that far to decide yet. I guess I'll tell you in a couple years.///[neutral]Call me cynical, or whatever. Maybe I'll think different in a couple years. I can't guarantee who I'll be then. Cats change.","[neutral]Lots of cats are working hard at a job that sucks and I don't get it. Just because society says you have to constantly advance doesn't mean it's true, or even right.///[thinking]If I'm having fun doing what I'm doing, I chalk that up to a success. No need to think more than a couple days ahead. Am I having a good time? Yeah. That's enough for me.///[thinking]If I stop having fun, I'll reconsider. I'll probably move on to something else. It's whatever. No need for a five year plan. It's dumb to think you could predict five years into the future anyways. How arrogant.","[happy]I'm young, so I'm going to have a good time while I still can. No back pain or aching limbs yet, so I better climb every tree I can find and make use of my energy and strength.///[neutral]When I'm too old for that stuff, I'll make art or something. Maybe collect branches and scratch them up. I have no idea what I'll do, but it doesn't matter. I'll figure it out.","[playful]I remember all the other kittens dreaming of the future when they'd get with the perfect significant other and live the rest of their lives in love.///[angry]Yuck, what a gross concept. They thought they could force it. It's laughable, really.///[blushing]I had a different strategy. I never set out to meet someone, but you came into my life and now we're chilling together. Obviously it worked out OK for me.///[neutral]I think life's like that. You've got to roll with the waves and fate will bring you what it wants to bring you. Maybe that includes love, maybe it doesn't. I don't know.///[neutral]I'm no expert on these things, but I do know one thing. You can't force it.","[neutral]It's crazy to think that we're alive at all. Out of all the stars and trees and stuff, we exist. We have thought and consciousness.///[thinking]In the grand scheme of things, we aren't all that important. Just tiny cats strolling around the world. Might as well have fun while we're here. Get some [green]Catnip[/green], roll around in some mud, whatever. Who cares?///[thinking]It's your life. You didn't ask for it, and neither did I. But we're here, so we best make the most of it and enjoy it while it lasts.","[sad]I'm just so done with everything. If you ever felt the need to cheer me up, now would be the time. I'm having a bad day!///[angry]Why am I so bad at everything?? I can't even sneak up on a [green]Shrew[/green] without it smelling me. I'm a failure!","[happy]I act all big and tough, but the truth is I'm glad you found me. I can't really explain it, but I do feel warm and comfortable when you're around. Never felt that before.///[shocked]Is that normal? Should I see #npc_name_krampy# or whatever? You feel it too, right?",[sad]I knew it was wrong of me to get so invested in you. It always ends poorly. Everybody leaves me sooner or later.,"[happy]I don't know what this emotion is. I guess it's love that I feel. How do you even know what words to put on your feelings?///[thinking]Maybe every cat experiences love a little differently. I'd buy that. There's no way it's a one-size-fits-all sort of emotion.///[blushing]We have a great time together, right #player_name#? And we care about each other. I think that's the definition of love.","[blushing]Hey, I didn't used to spend much time in my den, but yours is nice.///[playful]I'm going to have to redecorate, of course. It's not entirely my style, heh.","[playful]Hey, you've got some fur sticking up straight right on the back of your neck! Thought you'd want to know before you go to any important meetings or whatever.///[blushing]I can flatten it for you if you want. Here, let me give it a good lick. That's better!///[playful]Sorry if you think I tease you about your appearance. It's too fun to not tease you, #player_name#. Your reactions are priceless!","[thinking]If I were #leader_title_with_article#, I'd kick out everybody that I didn't like. I wouldn't even need a reason. If someone looked at me funny, that would be it! Gone.///[blushing]I guess that's why you're #leader_title_with_article#, not me. I wouldn't be very good at the job.","[neutral]I always hear stories about cats who write poems and songs and whatever to express their love. Isn't that lame?///[happy]Can you imagine if I felt the need to be serenaded in order to win your affection? What a joke. If you have to resort to cheap tactics, it probably isn't a strong enough relationship to last.///[blushing]I think cats should just hang with whoever they're comfortable with. Love who you wanna love. No need for theatrics. It only makes you look desperate.","[shocked]Why are you always so busy? I want to spend time with you, too!///[thinking]Don't forget to carve some time out for #npc_name_charlotte#, ok?","[neutral]Lots of cats, especially the older ones, will judge you for who you pick as your partner. Can you believe that?///[angry]I can't imagine being so bored that the only thing I find enjoyment in is scolding other cats for who they love. It's ridiculous.///[neutral]That's why I don't make it a habit of listening to what other cats think. What do they know, anyways? We're all just figuring things out as we go.","[happy]You're giving off a great vibe today, #player_name#. I can feed on that energy. It lights a fire under me when I see you beaming like that.///[thinking]As a rule, I try not to let others' emotions affect me, but I'll admit that you're something of an exception. I like seeing you happy.///[playful]If there's anything I can do to make you even happier, let me know #player_name#. I'm in a generous mood today. Don't get used to it!","[blushing]Oh gosh, I just lost my train of thought. Lame. I had something important to talk to you about.///[shocked]Darn it.","[thinking]I've got to admit, I was pretty skeptical of this whole marriage thing. It didn't work out for my parents, or practically anybody I know.///[shocked]But I've got a good feeling about us, #player_name#. So far so good, right? No reason that has to ever change.///[happy]As long as we keep each other in mind and try to work things out, there's nothing that can get in our way.///[thinking]Nobody except us gets to decide what works or what doesn't work for our lives.","[happy]I like your eyes. It's my favorite part about you, #player_name#. They're sort of mesmerizing.///[blushing]What's your favorite thing about me?","[neutral]We had a weird ride to the top, didn't we #player_name#? I was thinking about how we got started and the journey that lead us to where we're at now.///[happy]We definitely didn't have a traditional relationship. I love that about us. I wouldn't change a thing.///[playful]You were so dorky back then. You still are, to be honest. It's cute. I grew to like it.","[shocked]Some days it's easy to let your doubts get you down. I can get really trapped in my thoughts. Let's talk about something happy, maybe you can snap me out of it.///[thinking]So, what are you up to tomorrow? Got anything on your schedule? If it's something fun, count me in.","[neutral]Hey, if I ever get on your nerves, let me know how you really feel. Don't hold back. You know I don't when I'm upset.///[thinking]Feelings are real and valid, even negative ones. Sometimes you've just gotta voice them. You'll feel a lot better if you do, and I promise I can take it.///[neutral]I don't ever want you to feel like you have to put on a mask around me. I hate it when people do that. It's so fake and gross.","[shocked]Not really in the mood for talking today! Not your fault, by the way.///[blushing]You'd know if I were upset with you, #player_name#. I'm not. It's just one of those days when I want to sit in silence and stare at a tree or whatever.","[playful]Married life can be pretty monotonous. What if tonight we snuck out of #colony_title_with_article# and curled up under the stars?///[happy]You've got to do stuff to spice up life, or else it'll get boring. We can't have that!","[happy]Hey, I'm not the most organized cat. You knew that when you married me. Don't get on my case about not organizing the storage or picking up, 'cause it's not gonna happen.///[playful]I do lots of other important stuff around here! For example, I keep you in line. If it weren't for me, you wouldn't be half as cool, you know.","[blushing]I think I have some dirt in my fur on my back. You wanna lick it for me?///[happy]It's right out of reach. Oh, and while you're at it, you can give me a back rub if you want. What else is marriage for, right?","[thinking]I gotta say, I was wrong about you. Which is weird, because my intuition is usually scary accurate.///[neutral]I can tell at a glance if I'm going to get along with pretty much any cat, but it must have misfired when I met you. I don't know what it was, but I didn't like you at first.///[blushing]That seems so silly now! You're a great cat. I can't imagine not having you around. Thanks for giving me a real chance, #player_name#. It must have been difficult.","[happy]I think I'm going to go out hunting tomorrow. I've been craving some [green]Snake[/green] lately.///[neutral]You want anything in particular? I've got a pretty good nose, I could try to track it down for you. Put in your order!","[neutral]I've got a policy that I don't go out of my way to introduce myself to anyone, no exceptions. That includes kittens, even yours.///[thinking]That being said, I like the vibe that your #npc_name_kittenfour# is giving off. I can't believe you actually had a cool kid, #player_name#. Weird.///[neutral]I guess anything's possible.","[thinking]Ummm... What the heck are you wearing, #player_name#. There's only one cat who can pull off a look like that, and it isn't you.///[neutral]If you weren't #leader_title_with_article# I'd consider ripping it right off your neck, alright?","[neutral]I made a huge mistake this morning, #player_name#. I accidentally trotted past #npc_name_alabaster#'s den and they came out and started talking to me.///[sad]Blah blah blah! Does that cat ever shut up? I ought to teach them a lesson next time it happens.","[thinking]Hey, you wanna commiserate with me about our neighbors? It's a favorite hobby of mine, as you know.///[angry]What's the deal with #npc_name_garlic#, anyway? If they weren't always so down in the dumps I'd actually think they were pretty cool. But their energy is just... off. Ick.","[angry]I came out here to be alone! Not to be pestered by some self-important #leader_title# or something. Gross.///[thinking]I'm going to have to start wandering farther and farther away from town if I ever want to be by myself, huh?","[neutral]You know those runes carved into the entrance of #npc_name_glimmer#'s den? Totally rad, right?///[neutral]Anyways. I've been hatching a plan all day of how I can steal them. Gotta take the whole doorway with them I'd imagine.///[thinking]You think they actually work to keep cats out of your personal space? That's the dream. I sure hope they do.",,,,,,"[neutral]I'm just here for the drama.

Showed me a better way to live.///[thinking]Back then, in my darkest days, I never imagined a beautiful future with a wonderful cat like yourself. I know that younger #npc_name_coco# would be proud of how far I've come. I attribute most of that to you, #player_name#.","[happy]I was having a rough morning, but the sight of your face turned it all around. I can't be upset when you're around!","[blushing]I know I'm not the most affectionate cat, at least not in public. I do hope that hasn't bothered you, #player_name#. If it does, speak up, and we can talk about it.","[blushing]Did you ever date when you were younger, #player_name#?///I'm new to all this, so I don't have any experience to rely on. I'm worried I'll make a mess of things by accident.","[neutral]Are you comfortable around kittens, #player_name#?///[blushing]...Sorry, was that too forward of me? I have a habit of being a bit too direct. I'm working on it.","[happy]It's hard to imagine a future without you, #player_name#. Do you think about our future together? I can't imagine a better way to spend the days of my life than by your side.","[blushing]I hope this isn't too direct, but have you been jewelry shopping recently? There's a rumor going around that you're planning something.///[happy]I won't say anything more because everybody knows it's bad luck if you say your wish out loud!","[happy]You're such a special cat, #player_name#. I can feel your love for me so strongly. It comes through in our everyday conversations and your thoughtful gifts.",[blushing]Don't you think it's time we advanced our relationship to the next level? I've thought things through and I know my feelings for you are true.,[angry]I don't know what to say. I'm speechless.,[blushing]What an adventure the past few days have been! Being married to my best friend is such a good feeling.,"[happy]Forward motion! It's good to always think about the next step ahead. But it's also good to stop and pause from time to time and enjoy the things you have.///[playful]This is a special time for us both, and we should take the time to revel in it before it passes us by.","[blushing]I hope you don't mind my snoring. If it's bothering you, just wake me up and politely ask me to stop. I can't help it!","[playful]You know, I used to sleep on a stone floor, back before the big journey out here. Your bed is so much more comfortable, #player_name#.","[happy]What do you have on your schedule today, #player_name#? If there's anything I can help you with, I'd love to tag along.","[happy]I've thought about rearranging the den, but I figured I'd ask for your approval first. After all, you've lived here a lot longer than I have!",[neutral]Nothing like spending some quality time with the one you love. Maybe later we can spend some time together down by the lake?,"[happy]Have you ever sat back and watched the sunset? It sounds so romantic, but I've never had the chance to slow down and take it all in. Maybe one of these days I can convince you to try it out.",[happy]Being married is great! We can divvy up all our household chores between the two of us.///[playful]If there's something I don't like doing I can just get you to do it! Ha!,"[neutral]I'd like to think I'm a neat and tidy cat when it comes to my personal belongings. If it's not too much effort, I'd ask that you try to keep the den in order. For my sake.///[happy]Thanks, #player_name#.","[shocked]Oh, you've caught me! I was slacking off for a couple minutes.///[happy]I don't have a lot to do today, and I'm super bored. Maybe you can think of something fun?","[playful]Are you headed to the borders today, #player_name#? I would love to head out that way to look for a [green]Marigold[/green]. I think the den could use some fresh flowers, don't you?",[sad]My fluffy fur keeps getting all tangled and gross. It takes some serious upkeep when you've got long hair like me!///[happy]Maybe I can convince you to groom it for me?,"[neutral]A [green]Shrew[/green] was running around the den earlier. It's like he had no regard for the danger he was in!///[thinking]I chased him off. No, I didn't catch him. I'm not very good at hunting, as you know.","[happy]Maybe at the next festival we can pick out some furniture for the den? I like what we have, but it's always nice to try something new.","[blushing]You remember when we first started dating? It felt like life was at an all-time high. I couldn't imagine anything better than that.///[happy]But being married to you has been even better! You're the best, #player_name#. And don't you forget it!","[happy]We've been together for quite a long time, #player_name#. I was worried you'd get bored with me and move on to something else, but so far so good it seems. Thanks for sticking around.","[neutral]There were some thorny weeds growing at the entrance of the den. They kept sticking to my fur, so I picked them this morning. Should be much better now!","[happy]You've got a lot on your plate, #player_name#! Between leading an entire #colony_title# and managing a family, I don't know how you do it.///[shocked]I guess I'm in a similar boat, now that I think about it. [happy]But it doesn't feel like work at all when everything in life is so good!","[playful]I love our conversations, but more than anything I love our time spent together. If you're not too busy, could we take a stroll around #colony_full_name_with_article# together? What do you say?","[playful]I see that you're still finding the time to fulfill your duties in spite of your rather full home life, #player_name#. It's admirable.///[happy]Not many cats would be getting as much done as you do after having four kittens of their own. You have set quite an example for us all.","[neutral]#player_name#. The rumor around town is that you've entered into something of a relationship, is that right?///[happy]I think that's wonderful. Can there be a stronger #colony_title# than one which is held together by love?",[thinking]Hmm. More than three years have passed since that fateful day. Three years for the sting of the destruction of the old temple to fade. And yet...///[neutral]I still dream of that dark day. Will I ever be free of it?,"[neutral]If you are ever looking for me and cannot find me, it is likely that I am here, in the temple.///[neutral]I find that my thoughts are sharpened in this hallowed space. Whenever I need to make an important decision this is the first place I come. It seems you do the same.///[thinking]We are lucky to have a #leader_title# as reverent towards the [blue]guardian[/blue] as you.","[neutral]I spend some time in the mornings admiring the artwork on display around my den. It helps to warm up my mind.///[happy]It is a beautiful collection, wouldn't you agree? It took great effort to piece it all together.","[thinking]I am taking a short reprieve from my duties, but if there's anything you need urgently please do let me know. It would be my honor to assist our #leader_title#, as always.",,,,,,[thinking]#player_name#... You can do it. Never give in...,,,,,,,,,"[neutral]It is strange seeing a new face at the [red]Temple of the Forest Guardian[/red].///[thinking]Now that the #npc_name_thewildwoodchampion# has joined us, my visits there have become increasingly long and my conversations quite a lot more interesting...","[happy]Another day, another campsite to establish! This looks like as good a place as any. Flat ground and good hunting nearby according to the scouts.///[neutral]Let's all work together to ensure that we have adequate shelter and food before it gets dark.","[neutral]Of course #player_name# will make an announcement once we find our new home. For now, we've got to keep looking.///[thinking]We've all survived a difficult winter. Now that spring is here at last our luck may finally turn for the better. I suspect it will soon.","[thinking]Hey #player_name#, I'm going to go out and hunt. In the meantime do you suppose you could help #npc_name_spark# feel better?///[playful]I think #npc_name_spark# would cheer right up if they had some [green]Valerian[/green] to energize them. It's a pink herb that grows around here. Always puts a spring in my step.///[thinking]I saw a huge cluster of [green]Valerian[/green] just south of here, across the brook.///[neutral]Alright, I'm headed out to find some dinner. Remember, the [green]Valerian[/green] is just to the south. Best of luck to you!","[angry]Those pesky, slippery little [green]Mice[/green]...","[sad]I regret to inform you that I have returned empty-handed. Today does not seem to be my day.///[thinking]Perhaps someone else could try their luck. After all, we need to catch some food or we're all going to be very hungry.///[neutral]#player_name#, you've always been an excellent hunter. Would you care to accompany me? I'd be more than happy to point out where I smelled some prey.///[happy]Yes, I think this will work splendidly. The [green]Mice[/green] are just to the east through the forest and then a little south. I'll lead the way.","[happy]Excellent work, #player_name#!///[neutral]The clearing where I saw the [green]Mice[/green] is just to the south. I'll meet you there.","[neutral]Do you smell it, #player_name#? There's a [green]Mouse[/green] hiding somewhere around here...","[shocked]There! It's a [green]Mouse[/green]! Now's our chance!///[thinking]First, you'll need to [orange]sneak[/orange] so it won't see you coming. Get nice and close. The closer you are, the higher your chance of success.///[shocked]But don't get too close! If you do, the [green]Mouse[/green] will notice you and run away.///[neutral]Once you're near, [orange]pounce[/orange]! If you're successful you will have caught the [green]Mouse[/green].

You were so close to catching that [green]Mouse[/green], but it looks like it got away!///[neutral]That's alright! We all miss from time to time. You should try again. I'm sure you'll catch the next one!","[happy]Bravo, bravo! You caught it! Great work, #player_name#.///[thinking]Turns out all I needed was a buddy, because I caught one too. Now we won't have to return empty-handed.///[neutral]There's all sorts of prey you can hunt in the wild. Use your nose to track them down whenever you get hungry.","[shocked]Speaking of hunger, I think I just heard your belly rumble! You must be famished from all the work you've been doing today. When was the last time you had a bite to eat?///[happy]Good thing you have that [green]Mouse[/green]. You should probably [orange]eat it now[/orange] so you won't starve.","[happy]That looked like it was tasty.///[thinking]Remember to always pay attention to your hunger. It isn't good for your health to go too long without a meal.///[neutral]Alright, we've done our duty. I have a [green]Mouse[/green] to bring back with us. What do you say we get back to the campsite and see how it's coming along?","[shocked]Wait a minute... What on earth is that??///[sad]I don't like the look of that. What if it's dangerous?///[thinking]We should investigate before we head back. Think you could check it out, #player_name#?","[shocked]Uh oh, that doesn't look friendly! Looks like you're on your own for this fight. I can't get to you through this wall!///[neutral]You can do it, #player_name#! Keep a level head and I'm sure you can win. I'll give you some pointers.///[thinking]You can use your claws to swipe and deal some damage. It'll probably take a couple hits to take it down, judging from the look of it.///[neutral]Be careful to stay out of the way of its attacks. Be quick and agile to avoid taking damage.///[shocked]I'll be rooting for you from here, #player_name#! You've got this!","[happy]Nicely done #player_name#! You made quick work of that thing, whatever it was.///[shocked]Oh no! Looks like you've got company again. Watch out!","[sad]Two of them this time! What are you going to do?///[thinking]Oh, I've got it! You may find it easier to defeat them with a [purple]charged attack[/purple].///[neutral]You can wind up your attacks to unleash a more powerful variant and launch yourself into the battle.///[happy]Try it out, #player_name#!","[playful]You showed them! Well done #player_name#.///[neutral]And the path to the campsite is open again. I think when you defeated those voidling cats their shadowy wall went away, too.///[thinking]What do you think those things were? Why did they attack us? We'll need to report this to the others. They should know if there's danger around.///[neutral]Let's head back to the campsite and let everyone know what happened here.","[thinking]The good news is that #player_name# was able to defeat them. That means we stand a chance, right?///[happy]Whatever they are, they aren't invincible. I sure would like to learn more about them before the next time we encounter one.","[shocked]It's the #npc_name_theforestguardian#!///[thinking]We are honored to be in your presence, great [blue]guardian spirit[/blue]. I have missed you dearly these past few months. We all have.","[happy]A permanent settlement! Oh, this is wonderful! I think I speak for all of us when I say that we are ready to be home at last.///[thinking]But what of the [purple]voidling cats[/purple]?

How did you sleep?///[thinking]There's one final thing we need to do before #colony_full_name_with_article# is officially moved in.

It feels surreal, doesn't it?///[happy]You should take some time to get acquainted with our new home. Walk around town or take a trip out to the wilderness.///[playful]I'm certain you'll find something to do. There's plenty of good hunting and lots of herbs to forage outside of town. I'm sure everyone would love it if you'd stop by to say hello, too.///[happy]When you're ready, come to [orange]the Temple[/orange] and we can formally welcome the #npc_name_theforestguardian# together.///[playful]Alright, I'll leave you to decide what you'd like to do next!

You shouldn't go inside without an invitation until you get to know them better.///You can see that the interior is brightly lit with several sources of glowing light. There's some weird human-made items littering the floor.,"[happy]A visitor! I love it when cats come to visit. I've tried to make my den a great place for entertaining, but it's a work in progress.","[playful]Feel free to stop by my place any time you'd like!///[thinking]Well, except when I'm sleeping. I don't like to be woken up.","[happy]I wish I would have known you were coming, I could have prepared a snack.///[neutral]Oh well, maybe next time.","[happy]What do you think of my place? I think it could use some reorganizing, maybe you can help me move some furniture around.///[neutral]When you've lived in a place for too long, you start to forget what it looks like to anybody else.","[thinking]Welcome to my humble abode! It must be really bland compared to your den. I'll bet you live in a mansion!///[happy]And you should have the best den, #player_name#. You do so much for us, it's only fitting.","[playful]Well, this is nice! Having you over and all. You're a lot of fun, you know that #player_name#? And you always bring me such wonderful things.","[shocked]Oh, I meant to pick up all the clumps of hair from the floor. I shed way too much. That's why I've got to regularly bathe myself.///[playful]You know, you're welcome to help with that anytime!","[happy]I had some things to do, but this is way more fun. I'd spend an hour with you anytime over going grocery shopping!","[neutral]Seeing you here reminded me, I had a question for you. Where do you see yourself in five years?///[playful]Every cat has a plan! They just don't share it freely. You've got to do some digging if you want to learn about other cats' dreams.","[blushing]I'm pretty tired! I might take a nap. You can stick around, of course.///[happy]If you'd like, we can even cuddle for a bit. I think that'd be nice.","[thinking]...Sorry, I think I fell asleep there. What were you saying..?",[sad]It's way too early for conversation. Maybe later.,[thinking]I'm not really a morning cat. My mind still isn't firing on all cylinders.,[playful]The world is so much calmer at night. I can get a lot of thinking done when it's this late. Nice and quiet with no distractions!,"[thinking]Sometimes I gaze up at the stars and wonder how there can possibly be so many of them. What do you think they are, #player_name#?","[neutral]I'm about to turn in for the night! Getting sleepy, it's been a long day.",[neutral]Not a cloud in the sky! I'll probably just lounge about and soak in the sun. My chores will always be there tomorrow!,[shocked]All this moisture is bad for my fur! I wish this fog would roll out and leave me alone.,[playful]The rain is kinda refreshing! I used to play around in the rain when I was a kitten. Now I'm a sucker for a good rain shower.,[happy]Can you catch a snowflake on your tongue? It's like a free treat from the sky! Try it out!,"[shocked]You are a very brave cat to be out during this nasty storm! I'm sticking close to home, I don't want to be caught unaware if it worsens!","[sad]At the rate the snow is falling, my den will be snowed in by the morning! Stay warm, #player_name#! Hopefully it stops overnight.","[sad]Oh #player_name#, it's not good to see you this way. You should really do something about those nasty injuries. Rest up and come back when you're healthy!","[shocked]Woah, you look hungry! Take it from me, I'm always hungry. I know the look!","[angry]No, I'm not really in the mood for chatting. At least, not with you. Duh.","[neutral]I'm always free to chat! If you're looking to make a new friend, you've come to the right cat.///[thinking]So tell me about yourself, #player_name#.

Got something to share, #player_name#?","[neutral]I was wandering in the woods earlier and smelled the most delectable [green]Catnip[/green] scent, but try as I might I could not locate the elusive plant!///[sad]If you stumble across some, do let me know.","[thinking]I never bothered to learn how to fight. Hope that's not going to be an issue. I'll try to pull my weight in other ways, like gathering herbs.///[happy]That's much more in line with my personality anyways.","[neutral]You're a super cool cat, #player_name#. Do you give out autographs?///[happy]Haha, just kidding. ...Unless you do?///[blushing]Oh, never mind. I didn't mean it. Probably.","[neutral]I'm trying out this new stretching regiment. You've got to stretch once after breakfast, once after lunch, and once after dinner. Then, before you go to bed, you do it once more.///[playful]It's supposed to keep you limber. Do you suppose you also should stretch after snacking?","[thinking]Moving is always hard because you lose a lot of good friends in the process. Then you have to spend a lot of time making new ones.///[happy]I'm glad you've been stopping by so often, otherwise I don't know who I'd talk to!","[neutral]So you are tight with the #npc_name_theforestguardian#, right? After all, they're the one who gave you the blessing to lead this #colony_title#. That must be super cool!///[shocked]I've always been a bit intimidated by the #npc_name_theforestguardian#.

Otherwise we might have been on the road for quite some time!///It's like it was perfectly made for our #colony_title#. How serendipitous!,"[neutral]I've never had the ambition that some cats have. I'm not very driven. I know that about me, and I'm cool with it.///[thinking]All I want is a comfortable life, surrounded by good friends. I'm content with my slice of the world. Is there anything wrong with that?","[thinking]Every cat is different. That's what makes it so fun getting to know them!

I'm glad I could come on this adventure with you and #npc_name_coco#. It's hard to be bored when there's so much to explore!","[happy]Must be hard to be a #leader_title#. There's so many decisions that need to be made, right #player_name#?

I just hope you can see that.",[neutral]It's so nice to have such a great friend. I feel like we are kindred spirits.///[happy]Here's to the best of neighbors: #player_name#!,"[happy]If you know where to look, the woods are teeming with treasure. Just yesterday I stumbled across a nice [green]Catnip[/green] plant.///[playful]Isn't it amazing that we live in a world where herbs just grow from the ground and then sit there, ready for the taking?","[happy]This is, without a doubt, the best place I've ever lived.

Do they ever get on your nerves?///[happy]#npc_name_coco# and I go way back. We used to cross paths once a month, and things were always pleasant between us. I was just curious, that's all.","[neutral]I've always liked roaming far from my den from time to time, but I never want to get into a battle.///[happy]There's lots of good hiding spots in the forest where you can be alone with your thoughts, if you know where to look.","[angry]My fur bristles when you're around.

We can look for [green]Catnip[/green] together out in the woods!",[happy]I still smile whenever I think about that [green]Red Rose[/green] you gave me. I'm keeping it safe in a secret spot in my den. I don't ever want to forget how I felt when you handed it to me!,"[blushing]The first time our paws touched, I thought my heart was going to leap out of my chest. It felt electric! You felt it too, right #player_name#?","[neutral]I know you're a busy cat, so I'll try not to get in your way. Just make sure you block out some time to spend with me, OK? I miss you when you're gone.","[playful]You're so charming! How can I compete with you, #player_name#? It's not fair!","[happy]I'm in a cuddly mood, #player_name#. What do you say you take a break and we snuggle up together under a nice tree?","[blushing]My tail goes up automatically when I see you approaching. It's kinda embarrassing, but I can't really control it. It means I like you, I think.","[neutral]You probably think I'm always slacking off. I promise you, I'm not!///[thinking]I like to take my time and do everything with intentionality. I find it helps to ground me in the world and brings me a heightened sense of purpose.///[happy]I'm getting stuff done, but it's being done at my personal pace!","[happy]I've always wanted to be in a relationship. I knew it from a young age. But I never knew if I truly wanted a relationship, or if I just liked the idea of a relationship.///[thinking]Know what I mean?

What a unique color! It's very attractive to me.",[neutral]Surely you dated lots of cats before me. You seem to come by all this relationship stuff so naturally. It's either luck or practice.///[thinking]I hope I'm doing an alright job. I don't really have any experience to compare myself against.,"[happy]We've been dating for a while now, #player_name#. Have you given much thought to the future?///[thinking]To... Our future? It keeps me up at night. It's always frightening to stare down the rest of your life and try to decide what's right. Something to think about.","[blushing]Do you consider yourself a family cat, #player_name#? I've always wanted a large family to love on.","[blushing]It might be time to save up your [yellow]mews[/yellow] for a special gift, #player_name#.

It definitely feels strange waking up with another cat next to me.///It's kinda nice!","[happy]Our wedding was something special, wasn't it? You and me in front of the world, confessing our love for each other. It was so perfect.","[blushing]Don't you think we're perfect for each other? It's like we were made to be together. We compliment each other so well.///[happy]I don't know what you believe about destiny and fate, but maybe this was all meant to be. Perhaps the #npc_name_theforestguardian# would know more about that?",[neutral]I'm going to spend some time checking up on our supplies in the den. Do you know if we need anything from the store?,"[shocked]I tried to have lunch ready for you, but I was having some trouble with a particularly pesky [green]Shrew[/green]. Maybe tomorrow.","[playful]I think I'll get used to the married life pretty fast. How about you, #player_name#? What was the biggest surprise to you?","[happy]The furniture was getting a tad dusty, so I rolled around on it until it was clean.

There's no one to impress. Life is so much less stressful!///I'm grateful that you like me as I am.,[neutral]It's a nice day to spend time with family. There doesn't have to be any special occasion.

What's their deal?///[thinking]I tried my best to stop by and get to know them but they weren't having it.

Next time you see #npc_name_buttercup# do something extra nice for them, alright?///[neutral]I think they're having a hard time adjusting to life out here in the Wildwood.///[thinking]It would be very difficult to make new friends after a huge move like that if you were shy like #npc_name_buttercup# is, don't you think?///[neutral]Anyways, they're a really good cat and they could really use a friend.","[happy]You've caught me just in time, #player_name#!

It's easy to forget, but they won't be around forever!",[blushing]I heard some cats pick lots of flowers and organize them into a bouquet. Doesn't that sound lovely?,[happy]We should spend some time checking in with everybody else. Not every cat's year has been as nice as ours!,[thinking]Next year I should bring my wares to the festival. Lots of cats are getting tired and hungry. Could make for some easy [yellow]mews[/yellow]!,[playful]I always loved running around in the summer sun. It feels like I'm a kitten again!,"[blushing]Something about this time of year reminds me about when we were first dating. You remember what that was like, #player_name#?",[neutral]#npc_name_coco# says this year's festival should be even better than last year's. What do you think they meant by that?,"[blushing]When it gets dark it will probably get pretty cold. Good thing I have someone to keep me warm, right #player_name#?",[happy]Maybe we can take one of the pumpkins home when the party's over? Imagine how nice it would look in our den! I'll have to ask #npc_name_coco#.,[thinking]Year's end is busy season for the shop. I have a lot of paperwork to do. Got to update my spreadsheets. It's nice to have some time to pause and reflect.,"[happy]Every year brings something new. I'm grateful we'll be entering the next one as a couple, #player_name#.","[playful]What a wonderful day! First we go to a great party, then we get to return to a nice warm den together. I couldn't ask for more.","[neutral]This is a great time to restock the shop. Plenty of critters running about. If you're ever looking to make some extra [yellow]mews[/yellow], I'm always buying!","[neutral]It's not uncommon to get a lot of rain around this time of year. Usually it's just a drizzle, but sometimes there's big storms that roll through.","[happy]Every cat seems so happy. The [green]butterflies[/green] are flying above the meadows, the [green]mice[/green] are scurrying in the forest, and there's not a care in the world.","[happy]If you're working up a sweat, feel free to take a break in the shade. Work is important, but taking some time to enjoy the warm weather is important too.","[neutral]There's a chill in the air. Have you felt it, #player_name#?","[shocked]Pretty soon, the trees will all be bare! Better enjoy the autumn colors while they last.","[neutral]This snow sure did move in fast, don't you think #player_name#? One day we had nothing on the ground, and now it won't go away. How long do you suppose winter will last?",[thinking]This is a hard time for many cats. Make sure you're keeping up with everybody. We can't have any cats feeling left out!,This is #npc_name_ember# and #npc_name_spark#'s den. It would be rude to enter uninvited until you get to know them better.///It looks cramped inside. Evidently they use their den to store inventory for the shop?,"[shocked]I do use some of my personal living space for extra storage for the shop. I'm not a hoarder, I promise!","[thinking]I've been told that there's an art to balancing a room. Certain colors belong in certain corners, or so they say.///[neutral]Some believe organizing your furniture just right can bring about luck and fortune.///[thinking]What do you think, #player_name#? Do you believe that too?","[happy]Well, this is the shop! I've got my own little corner in the back where I can take it easy when I'm not working.///[happy]Every cat needs a good spot to retreat to that they can arrange however they see fit.","[shocked]Oh, where are my manners? You're a visitor, not a customer. I should have offered you some water. Would you like some water? I think I have some in the back...","[neutral]I always dream about hosting a big party in this space. I know it's not much, but I think I could make it work.///[happy]Don't you love it when you can get together with a big group of friends?","[blushing]Oh, I use the back of the den as overflow storage for the shop. I hope you don't mind too much. It's a bit unsightly, I know.","[thinking]Sorry, I'd love to spend more time with you, but now's not a perfect time for a visit. #npc_name_spark# is in trouble at the moment, so it's a bit tense here.///[neutral]I'm sure you understand. Maybe stop by tomorrow? I'm sure I can make time for it then.","[happy]I'd like to think it's a tad more cozy in the back of the den, away from the merchandise.///[neutral]Well, that's the mood I've been trying to go for, but I'm not sure I've achieved it. Either way, it's home.","[shocked]The roof started leaking yesterday. There's always something to repair around here.///[blushing]Oh, don't lift a paw! I've got it. I don't need you to do my work for me. I'm confident you have plenty to do without my problems adding to the list!",[playful]It's nice to see you here. Especially when I have the whole den to myself. Everything feels different when #npc_name_spark# is around.///[thinking]Do you think I've been too harsh on them? Seems like they're always in trouble. I really want us to have a good relationship. It's hard being a parent.,"[happy]Another early riser, I see! That's commendable, #player_name#.","[neutral]Hitting it hard this morning, #player_name#? Most cats are still asleep!///[happy]I guess when you're #leader_title_with_article# you've got more important things to think about than sleep.","[happy]There's nothing like watching the early morning sunrise, right #player_name#?///[thinking]The light starts to filter through the trees in such a magical way. I wouldn't want to miss it.","[thinking]Burning the midnight oil? Make sure you get enough sleep, too. Sleep is important.","[thinking]When I was a kitten, I loved staying up late. The later, the better! Pulled my share of all-nighters, too.///[neutral]Now I have difficulties with these long nights. I'm going to sleep well when I finally turn in!","[neutral]You must have a good reason to be up at this time of night. Otherwise you'd be in bed, like everybody else!","[neutral]Blue skies as far as the eye can see! Should be a nice day for knocking out your to-do list, #player_name#.",[thinking]The good thing about this fog is that no ferocious animals will want to wander far from their homes. We should be grateful for our safety.,[thinking]It's a bit miserable with this drizzle. Maybe it will let up later?///I'm tired of shaking the water out of my fur!,[neutral]Winter's not all bad. This snow can help to preserve dead prey a bit longer than it would otherwise be good to eat.///[thinking]Every season is a blessing in its own special way. We disrespect nature when we suggest otherwise.,"[shocked]This storm is no joke! Don't wander too far from shelter, #player_name#. You never know when it might pick up!",[angry]How am I suppose to run a business with all this nasty weather? It's driving all my usual customers away!,"[shocked]Woah, #player_name#, are you feeling OK? You look like you're hardly conscious! I might have some herbs for sale, let me check.","[playful]You look like you've been working up quite an appetite! Lucky for you, I just got a new shipment of delicious prey. Have a look!","[sad]Let's keep our personal lives and our professional lives separate. I'll never turn a customer away, but I'm not up for having a conversation, either.","[happy]I'm on break so I'd be glad to take a minute to get to know you. You seem like a hard worker, #player_name#. I'm sure you'll make your #colony_title# proud.",[thinking]I've spent a lot of time trying to get #npc_name_spark# to take their shifts at the shop more seriously.///[angry]Maybe you can talk some sense into them. That child of mine is so forgetful!,"[thinking]I used to be a bit of a jokester, but life has a way of beating you down. I've got more important things to do than sit around thinking up funny jokes.///[neutral]Becoming a parent is a trial in its own right. Also very rewarding, but it's hard work.",[neutral]I sincerely hope that my shop will make everyone's lives easier. This #colony_title# relies on all of us to do our best and provide value to the lives of others!,"[neutral]Accounting work is boring and I could use a break. Counting on your paws all day is a great way to zone out quick if that's what you want.///[shocked]Oh, shoot. I just lost track! Now I'm going to have to start over again.","[thinking]My shop is something of a family business. It was passed down through many generations of excellent business-cats who grew it into what it is today.///[neutral]I'm trying my best to continue the proud tradition of my ancestors and keep the shop alive. Some day, #npc_name_spark# will take over when I'm gone.///[sad]At least, that's the plan...","[neutral]If you want to be a good sales-cat, you've gotta know your customer better than they know themselves! That's my motto. Doesn't that sound nice?///[happy]That's why I like chatting with customers like yourself. It gives me valuable insight into what your needs may be.","[thinking]I have a bad habit of talking to myself. If you ever stumble upon me mumbling, I'm probably zoned out and don't even realize it.///[shocked]It's kind of embarrassing! Just letting you know now so that you aren't freaked out when it inevitably happens.","[thinking]It's hard work running the shop. There's inventory to track, [yellow]mews[/yellow] to count, customers to satisfy... It can all be a bit overwhelming.///[neutral]On bad days, I remind myself of the important role I'm playing in getting this #colony_title# up and running. It makes the work all seem worthwhile.","[neutral]There's been some shortages this year. Sourcing fresh prey is tough, so I appreciate it when cats bring me their excess items. I'm always happy to buy!","[thinking]You've become one of the regulars around here. It's nice to have someone to talk to for a bit every day. Helps to mark the days and gives me something to look forward to when I open up.///[happy]Thanks for being such a loyal customer, #player_name#!","[neutral]Some cats think I must be rich because I'm dealing with so many [yellow]mews[/yellow], but the truth is that I'm operating at razor-thin profit margins. I make just enough to live a comfortable life, nothing more.///[happy]But that's OK with me! I'm happy to serve #colony_full_name_with_article# and make things easier for everybody. I could always raise my prices, but I wouldn't want to make anybody suffer for it.///[playful]It's important to build customer loyalty by offering low prices and great deals.","[happy]Another day, another [yellow]mew[/yellow]! They say if you do what you love, you'll never work a day in your life. I disagree.///[thinking]I think I work even harder [b]because[/b] I do what I love to do. Passion is just the process of turning motivation into hard work!","[neutral]Have you always known you were well-suited to administration and leadership, #player_name#? Some cats have a vision of their career from an early age. Others have to find it along the way.///[happy]There's nothing wrong with either path in life.","[thinking]It wasn't easy to get the rights to the family shop. I had a lot of siblings to beat out, and they weren't messing around.///[neutral]At the end of the day I proved myself the most capable, and I'm very proud of that.///[thinking]This business was built, sustained, and grown through hardship and trials. I try not to lose sight of what it cost to get to where I am today.///[angry]That's why I get so frustrated with #npc_name_spark# sometimes. I know firsthand the sacrifices that were made! How could someone throw that all away?","[neutral]I always wanted a big family, like the one I grew up in. When #npc_name_spark# came along, I thought perhaps the litter would be bigger.///[thinking]At first I was sad that wasn't the case, but over time I've come to accept it.///[playful]#npc_name_spark# brought so much joy into my heart. Things are perfect as they are.///[thinking]I have to remind myself of that regularly. Life is good!","[happy]It's always nice to see you, #player_name#. I enjoy our time catching up. What's the latest around #colony_title_with_article#? Any interesting stories to share?","[playful]I was concerned when I moved out here that I wouldn't make friends easily. I have a habit of getting wrapped up in the work and forgetting everything else.///[happy]Thankfully, you've proven me wrong! I value our friendship, #player_name#.","[neutral]It's nice to have someone to bounce business ideas off of, #player_name#. Not every cat has a mind for strategy like you do. I respect your opinions because you've proven yourself to be very capable.","[happy]Not every cat is cut out for hunting. Not every cat is made for fighting. Not every cat can identify which plants are safe and which are toxic. That's why a shop is such a vital resource!///[thinking]Through our free-market economy, all cats have access to the things they otherwise wouldn't be able to acquire. It's a wonderful system.","[sad]I hate to complain, but something about our relationship feels... off. You feel it too, right #player_name#?","[blushing]I find myself looking forward to when I get off work because it means I get to spend some time with you, #player_name#. That didn't happen before we started dating. Weird, huh?","[thinking]I don't like to talk about it, but I was in another relationship before. With #npc_name_spark#'s other parent, of course.///Things didn't work out then, so I'm always a bit cautious about this relationship stuff. Does that make sense to you? Try not to take it personally.",[happy]I have a terrible penchant for getting stuck in my routine. Luckily I have you to shake things up!,"[playful]I'd love to give you some presents, but I trust you understand that I still have a business to run. I can't just go around giving my inventory away for free, not even to you!","[thinking]I'm enjoying this new adventure, but let's take our time and take things slow, alright? I've got a lot of processing to do before we get too serious.",[happy]You sure are chipper today! Maybe it's because you're around me. I've noticed your face light up when you turn around the corner. It makes me feel warm inside.,"[thinking]No matter what happens, I'm going to keep running the shop. My career is the most important thing to me. Aside from being a parent, of course.","[thinking]I went through some dark days when #npc_name_spark#'s other parent left me. There were a lot of days where I felt abandoned and overwhelmed.///[sad]The world can be an unfair, cruel place sometimes. I never want that to happen again.///[thinking]You'll have to excuse me for not wanting to talk about it. I know that must be tough on you.","[neutral]Life would have been a lot simpler if I had known you all those years ago. Back when I was younger and unattached. I don't think you'd ever do anything to hurt me, #player_name#.","[thinking]I have a lot of obligations, #player_name#. Being an adult has a way of piling on responsibilities and refusing to let up. #npc_name_spark#, the shop, #colony_title_with_article#... It's a lot to manage.///[happy]So it's nice to spend time with you and forget all about those other worries.","[neutral]I spent some time as a house cat, #player_name#. Well, sort of. The humans let me come and go as I pleased, but they always left out food for me.///[thinking]It was a decent life, but I could never go back to it. That's when I met my ex. Too many bad memories associated with that time in my life.","[thinking]It's exciting to be in a relationship, but you have to put the emotions aside and think about the ramifications. It can be hard to do, but it's an important exercise.///[shocked]After my last relationship ended the way it did, I promised myself I would never rush into another one without weighing it carefully.","[happy]You always have a spring in your step, #player_name#. What's your secret? You're always dashing around, so full of life and energy!///[neutral]Maybe that's something I could regain. Some day. With plenty of help and patience.","[playful]I tried writing you a nice note, but I realized pretty quickly that I'm not the best with words. Why is it so hard to express the way I feel?","[playful]When I was younger, I used to think that all this relationship stuff was based on feelings. And it is, but not just that.///[thinking]There's so much more to consider when it comes to compatibility. Your own heart can deceive you, so you've got to use your mind as well. It's not an easy thing to do.","[neutral]You've given me a lot to think about, #player_name#. Plenty of times I zone out at the shop trying to add everything up.///[thinking]I'm not making a mistake, am I #player_name#?","[happy]#npc_name_spark# sure seems happy these days. You know, I think that cat is going to be alright after all.///[neutral]They just needed some time to find their way.","[thinking]I've given things a lot of thought, but I have a difficult time acting on my decisions. I'm sorry if that's off-putting, #player_name#. You'll have to be patient with me.","[blushing]It's nice to be with a cat who cares about my needs. I'm grateful that we've gotten to know each other so well, #player_name#. You're a good cat.","[happy]This is a happy season of life. I'm trying to enjoy each day as it comes and not think too far ahead. If I get trapped in my own mind, I start worrying too much.///[shocked]The past and the future can rob you of the joy of the present if you're not careful.","[angry]It's happening all over again, isn't it? Oh, I knew this was a bad idea. Never again #npc_name_ember#. Never again.","[neutral]I spoke to the #npc_name_theforestguardian#, and they told me it was time to move past what's behind and look to the future.///[happy]I'm a new cat, #player_name#! The #npc_name_ember# of today is not the #npc_name_ember# of the past. Thank you for your persistence in loving me.","[blushing]These are the honeymoon days of our relationship. They should be cherished and enjoyed, #player_name#!","[happy]It's so nice to have someone so close. I spent so much time pushing other cats away. I'm glad I let you in, #player_name#.","[playful]You make me very happy, #player_name#. You're kind, considerate, and infinitely patient. I don't know what I did to deserve you, but I'm glad you're here in my life.///[happy]I'm a little older and a little wiser. We're going to build a very strong marriage, I know it.",[blushing]I do apologize if I get a bit snuggly in the middle of the night. When I have nightmares it's nice to have someone there to reassure me that everything's alright.,"[neutral]#npc_name_spark# is going to be alright, don't you think? They're out on their own now, which is a new experience.///[thinking]I was looking for an excuse to push them towards independence for some time now, and this has worked out great I think.","[neutral]It must be odd, being married to someone with an adult child already. #npc_name_spark# will always be an important part of my life, so I appreciate your acceptance.","[happy]My my, I'm staying busy these days! Between a new spouse and a booming business, things are quite lively around here!///[playful]I wanted to say thanks for all you do to support us. I couldn't do this alone, #player_name#.","[blushing]You got a minute, #player_name#? My tail could use some fluffing out. It's getting so itchy with all this dry air.","[thinking]Owning a business is tricky business. It's always feast or famine, you know what I mean? It's hard to predict how things will be in the future.///[happy]I used to have to ride out the tides alone, but now I have you to lean on when I need the extra support. I'm so thankful for you, #player_name#!","[thinking]It's been a very long time since I said this to anyone sincerely, but I mean it.///[blushing]I love you, #player_name#. I think I always will.","[neutral]It's nice to come home to a nice, clean den after a long day's work at the shop.///[happy]It lets me know that you love me!","[blushing]I know you like adventuring out in the wilderness, and as our #leader_title# you have to check out the borders often. I get it.///[shocked]But try to remember that I'm waiting for you at home! Don't do anything that would have me too worried, OK #player_name#?","[playful]I never know how to express my feelings, #player_name#. In some ways I still feel damaged by what happened to me all those years ago, but I know that I'm healing, too.///[happy]You've been an important part of that process, and every day I wake up grateful to have such an awesome cat at my side!","[playful]I've been running the numbers, and I think we'll have a surplus this month. Was there anything you were saving up for? It might be nice to treat ourselves for all our hard work.","[blushing]I love you, #player_name#! I know that you accept me as I am, and I'm not blind to how difficult that must be.///[happy]You are strong, brave, and smart, and I don't want you to ever think less of yourself.","[happy]There were some lunch leftovers at the back of the den stinking up the place so I tried to tidy up a bit. If you're looking for anything in particular I might have moved it in my cleaning frenzy, just let me know.","[shocked]My career takes me out of the house often, which must be hard for you. I'm so grateful to have a supportive spouse!",[playful]We both have very stable positions. I try not to forget the blessings that have come our way. We are fortunate to be together and to have built such a great life.///[thinking]It's easy to forget all the hard work that it took to get here. We should be very proud of ourselves.,"[neutral]I might take a break to go looking for herbs. My inventory is getting low. If you want to come along, we can go together!///[happy]The work day seems to go a bit faster whenever you're around, #player_name#.","[thinking]Hey #player_name#, I really enjoy having kittens running around town as much as the next cat, but can you let #npc_name_kittentwo# know not to get into my storage room?///[happy]I mean, they're very sweet and all, but the other day I spent an hour looking for a misplaced [green]Squirrel[/green] that I knew I had laying around.///[neutral]Turns out #npc_name_kittentwo# was playing with it in the corner.","[thinking]I've been trying to get #npc_name_spark# to take their shifts at the shop more seriously. I can't keep them at their post for more than an hour at a time.///[angry]The other day, they sold a [green]Mouse[/green] for the wrong price! Silly mistakes like that can sink a business quick.","[happy]Hey #player_name#. I hear you and #npc_name_spark# have been getting awfully close, haven't you?///[thinking]I've never seen #npc_name_spark# so happy. You two seem like a good fit. Thanks for being there for my kid. I won't forget it.","[neutral]I'm on the clock but it looks like there's a break in the line.///[thinking]It was very busy earlier. Thought I was going to run out of [green]Marigold[/green], but fortunately I found some in the back. Crisis averted!",[neutral]Seems like some cats stop by the shop just to socialize with their neighbors. I think it's wonderful that I can provide a place for our community to come together like that.///[playful]Of course if they talk too long and end up getting hungry there's a convenient meal waiting just behind the counter for a reasonable price. It's a real win-win.,"[angry]Ack, where did I put those herbs? They're in one of these boxes. I saw them yesterday and I know they didn't sprout legs and walk off!///[shocked]Maybe #npc_name_spark# moved them somewhere... I don't have time for this!",,,,,,[shocked]I'm rooting for you!,,,,,,,,,,"[neutral][purr]#npc_name_spark#, we really could use your help. Where are you going to sleep if the shelter is not built?///[thinking]You're not my little kitten anymore, you're an adult. We all need you to pitch in if you want to be treated like one.","[happy][purr]Thanks for your assistance, #player_name#. I'm glad you found that herb.///[playful]All cats appreciate a thoughtful gift. Giving out items that you find is a wonderful way to make friends.///[happy]Now we can continue working on the shelter. We'll take it from here!","[happy]I have to admit, as much as I like seeing the world it would be nice to build a shop and slip back into a daily routine after all this time.///[neutral]I've gathered quite a large inventory while we've been journeying. It's getting harder and harder to bring it with me when we move. I'm ready to stay in one place!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[neutral]I'm sorry for #npc_name_spark#'s behavior. I'll talk to them about it. There's no sense in being rude to anyone when there's work to be done.///[shocked]That child of mine can be a pain sometimes. If they were still a kitten I'd ground them or something, but now that they're older I'm not sure what to do.///[neutral]Anyways, I figure some [green]Valerian[/green] couldn't hurt one way or the other. I'll stay here to try to reason with #npc_name_spark# while you find it.","[happy]Oh, wonderful! I see you've tracked down the [green]Valerian[/green] for #npc_name_spark#. Hopefully a little bit of that will help with their attitude.","[neutral]We can take it from here!

Sorry #player_name#.","[thinking]Sorry, I'm not interested in buying that.",[happy]I appreciate your business!,[shocked]Oh no! You don't look like you have a free paw at the moment. Come back once you've made room for more.,"[shocked]Oh no! Looks like you can't afford that at the moment. Sorry, I need to make a living somehow.","[happy]When I think about you and #npc_name_spark# it brings me such joy.

Let me know if you want to head out again.","[playful]You look like you've got something on your mind! What is it, #player_name#?","[shocked]Yikes, I'm all worn out!

Thanks, #player_name#!","[playful]Aw, a gift for my [rainbow]birthday[/rainbow]? That's so thoughtful of you, #player_name#.","[thinking]I'm glad you remembered my special day, #player_name#. That's what really matters...","[thinking]Hrmmm... [blushing]Thanks, #player_name#... What a... [i]unique[/i] gift...","[neutral]Thanks, but you've already given me something today. Maybe someone else will want this?","[playful]You ever seen a #gift_item# like this one? I stumbled across it earlier today and immediately thought of you. Here, it's yours now! No need to thank me.",[happy]I was just headed your way to give you this #gift_item# for your [rainbow]birthday[/rainbow]! Don't you love the color? I saw it and immediately thought of you.,"[shocked]Wow, ok. Strong feelings flying everywhere. I don't like you either!","[blushing]Umm, that's kind of embarrassing! Put that away before somebody sees it!","[thinking]Yeah, I can't accept that. I don't want to make anybody angry with me. Not you, not #player_spouse_name#, not the rest of #colony_title_with_article#.","[shocked]What has gotten into you, #player_name#?? You're a married cat! Put that thing away!",[thinking]Now you're just showing off. Kind of tacky if you ask me.,"[playful]Oh, that looks just like the one you got me, #player_name#!","[blushing]Awww, what a sweet gift! I like you too, #player_name#, but you must have already known that.///[happy]Can we go on a date soon, just the two of us? I can't think of a better way to spend a day than with you!","[shocked]Hey, I'm still figuring things out, ok?","[happy]You're too sweet, #player_name#. But I only need one #item_name_shiny_trinket# to be happy, and you already gave it to me.","[blushing]I've never made a decision that feels quite as big as this one, but there's no way that I'm turning you down.///[happy]I'm so ready to marry you, #player_name#! We're perfect for each other!","[angry]I used to be into you, but lately you've been making it very hard to find anything about you remotely attractive.///[angry]I'm breaking up with you, #player_name#. You are an awful cat and I don't feel bad leaving you behind.","[sad]I'm not making this decision lightly. I spent a lot of time thinking it over. But we're through.///[angry]I cannot be in this relationship. You treat me like dirt, or maybe worse. Goodbye, #player_name#, I hope you can be happy with yourself.","[playful]Yeah, I can do that! You can count on me, #player_name#!","[blushing]This is such a beautiful moment, #player_name#. When I look deep into your eyes I can see both of our futures unfolding. I think we will always be happy together.","[playful]Whew, my heart was racing at a thousand beats a second up there! I'm glad that things have settled down now that the ceremony is over.///[happy]I'm going to make the rounds now and thank everyone for coming, ok #player_name#?","[happy]You did great up there, #player_name#!///[shocked]Oh, I don't know if that's the right thing to say.

Make sure you get them something nice.,"[happy]Happy [rainbow]birthday[/rainbow], #player_name#! You're a cat worth celebrating!",[neutral]This is just lovely. Think of all the hard work that must have gone into setting all of this up! We should thank #npc_name_coco# later.,[happy]Everybody seems to be having such a great time. That makes my heart happy.,[thinking]It was my understanding that we were past that phase. Conversation is not exactly on the table at the moment. I'm sure you can understand why.,"[neutral]Oh, hello. I was just trying to get #npc_name_lainey# to go hunting with me, but I wasn't making much progress on that front.","[neutral]Making the rounds again, #player_name#?

Right on time.",[sad]You're not making this easy.,[playful]I always knew what I wanted in life. It's satisfying to finally have it.,"[neutral]I know you've got a lot to do, but take some time for yourself too, #player_name#. You don't have to carry the weight of #colony_title_with_article# on your shoulders.","[playful]I'll take care of the chores around the den today, love. You've got lots of more important things to do! Go get 'em.","[happy]I'll always have your back, love. You've got this.","[neutral]When I was a kitten, my mother always made every effort to make my [rainbow]birthday[/rainbow] a special event. We'd always have #item_name_sparrow# for dinner.///[thinking]To this day, whenever I eat #item_name_sparrow#, I think of those wonderful times with family.///[happy]Do you have any annual traditions like that, #player_name#?","[thinking]Every year seems to go by a little bit faster than the last. What an odd sensation. At some point, you probably stop caring much for [rainbow]birthdays[/rainbow] altogether.",[playful]Just look at the flower arrangements! Someone put a lot of time into making everything beautiful. Shame it's only here for the day.,"[neutral]I used to spend all my time at festivals with #npc_name_lainey#, but now that we're dating I need to split my time. I'd hate for #npc_name_lainey# to feel alone or left out.///[shocked]It's an interesting problem to have! There's got to be some obvious solution.","[happy]How pleasant to attend as a family this year. The venue always reminds me of our special day, #player_name#.///[thinking]Do you remember what it looked like at our wedding? It's all a blur to me, I was focused on you.",[happy]It makes my heart happy to see #npc_name_lainey# having such a good time with the festival games. It's important to have a healthy outlet when you have so much energy like that.,[blushing]Do you think some of the others will be jealous because we're attending as a couple? I don't want to ruin anybody's day.,"[neutral]Married life can get a little monotonous at times, so it's nice to have a festive day like this to shake things up.///[happy]It's the perfect excuse to get out of the den and catch up with everybody!",[neutral]We never got to attend events like this when we were younger. It was a struggle just to survive.///[thinking]The fact that our #colony_title# can even put on something like this is a good sign that we've found a wonderful community.,"[neutral]I hope you don't get scared easily, #player_name#. I hear #npc_name_coco# spent a lot of time making this year's decorations extra spooky.///[happy]How silly! I love it. The world would be better off if we all devoted more time to frivolous fun like this, instead of bickering and fighting.","[happy]I saw #npc_name_krampy# hiding in a bush a couple minutes ago. Fair warning, #player_name#.",[neutral]Do you suppose we've seen the end of the snow for the year?///[thinking]I hope so. #npc_name_ember# told me the bad weather makes it hard to source some items for the shop. That must be difficult for them. We'll all be better off when it warms up.,"[blushing]Well, we've certainly had a full year, #player_name#. I wouldn't trade it for anything.///[happy]Here's to another awesome year with you!","[playful]It's funny. I was cold until you came by, now I feel warm from my head to toes! Love can have some pretty interesting side effects, huh?","[neutral]Mother always left the den early and returned late during the springtime. Lots of hunting to do when you have seven mouths to feed, I suppose.","[neutral]I've noted that the mornings have been a bit warmer and more tolerable lately. Sun's coming up earlier in the day, too. Hot weather is on its way!","[neutral]This humidity is like a blanket. Keeps the sweat in your fur, doesn't it? I'll probably head down to the lake to take a bath later. I feel sticky.","[neutral]Last night I peeked out the den to watch the [green]fireflies[/green]. It's quite the show.///[thinking]Legend has it that there's a rare variety that absorbs light instead of shedding it. That's nonsense, right?","[neutral]There's something about the chill in the air that makes me think of my childhood. I don't know why that is.///[thinking]They say that some sensations can instantly spark a vivid memory from your past. A certain smell, or a color, or a sound. Isn't that peculiar, #player_name#?","[neutral]I stopped by the clinic to talk to #npc_name_krampy# and they were positively giddy. Something to do with the upcoming festival, no doubt. I'd keep an eye on that cat if I were you.///[shocked]Mischief is afoot! Mark my words.","[playful]Seems like the snow has got everybody excited. It definitely makes for a pretty vista.///[neutral]If I were more creative, I'd paint a picture of #colony_title_with_article# with a light dusting of snow and hang it on the wall so I could remember how pretty it is when it's gone.///[thinking]Maybe I can talk #npc_name_lainey# into doing it..?","[happy]Wintertime is perfect for spending time with family. You can't be outside for too long so you have to stay in and talk. Isn't it wonderful?///[neutral]When we got bored of being inside as kittens, #npc_name_lainey# and I invented a board game with scratches in the dirt and some small pebbles. We called it [b]Rocks and Rabbits[/b]. I can't remember how to play it now.","This is #npc_name_fliss# and #npc_name_lainey#'s den. Neither of them are expecting you, so you should stay outside until you become more acquainted.///There's an identical set of nearly everything inside. Both sides of the interior look almost like a mirror image of the other!","[shocked]I feel like I'm always picking up after #npc_name_lainey#. If you can't see the ground, you've got too much clutter!///[sad]Sometimes I run out of time to clean my own space because I spend so much time worrying about #npc_name_lainey#'s side of the den.","[playful]Well, this is the den! It's a bit humble, but it's ours. Can I get you anything to make you more comfortable?///[shocked]Here, let me grab some grass to make a spot for you to sit. Hang tight, it'll only be a second.","[neutral]I've lived with #npc_name_lainey# since we were both very young. They have a couple quirks, but ultimately not a bad roommate. We work well together.","[neutral]Living with someone else isn't always ideal, but it sure is cheaper. Pros and cons.///[happy]Plus, you can steal your roommate's snacks when they aren't looking!///[thinking]...Don't tell #npc_name_lainey# I said that.",[playful]I never thought our esteemed #leader_title# would drop by for a visit. That's why I didn't declutter before you arrived. Sorry about that! Make yourself at home.,"[happy]I always love it when you come to visit me. I tried my best to clean-up before you arrived, but I might have missed a spot or two.","[thinking]Maybe next time we can hang out at your den? I love spending time with you, but it's a bit difficult to get alone time here, you know what I mean?","[angry]Be thankful you don't have a roommate. Don't get me wrong, it's awesome sometimes, but when you're just trying to impress your date, it leads to all sorts of problems.","[blushing]What do you think about the place? I'm honestly a little nervous whenever you come over still. I know I shouldn't be, but it's hard to shut down those emotions, you know?","[happy]I'm so glad you came over today. I missed you a lot, and now here you are!///[blushing]I never really thought about what it would be like to host for someone I'm in a relationship with... What am I supposed to do? Am I doing an OK job of it?","[neutral]The sun is coming up, but you can still faintly see the stars if you look closely enough. There's something very special about the early morning. It's almost magical.","[neutral]I've never needed much sleep, so I try to get up early when I can. There's lots to do around here, so the more waking hours a cat has the better in my opinion.","[thinking]You're an inspiration, #player_name#. We should all aspire to wake up as early as you. Then we'd get all our chores done by noon and have the afternoons to relax!","[happy]Wow, the moon sure is bright tonight. Do you suppose the moon is somehow linked to the #npc_name_theforestguardian#? I've always thought they had some similarities.","[neutral]Some cats have already turned in for the night. You must be getting pretty tired, #player_name#.///[thinking]It's important to get some sleep when you need it. The mind does a lot of processing over night. Maybe dreams play a role in that. Either way, sleeping has a bunch of benefits for your health.","[shocked]Does it seem really dark to you tonight? Maybe it's a bad omen. I wouldn't know for sure, but I don't like the look of it.","[neutral]It's the perfect day to knock out my chores list. I've got a couple things to pick up from the shop, but first I need to find something to give to #npc_name_ember# when I'm over there.///[happy]By the way, I have it on good authority that they really like the taste of #item_name_squirrel#! In case you were curious.","[shocked]Woah, do you think this fog is the #npc_name_theforestguardian#'s doing? It looks so creepy. What do you think its purpose is?",[neutral]The rain really doesn't bother me. #npc_name_lainey# and I learned to swim at a very young age. Mother said it would help us to stop freaking out about getting our fur wet. Seems like it worked!,"[neutral]I keep thinking maybe the snow will melt, and then more comes down. Oh well, I'll just have to accept that I'm very bad at predicting these things.///[playful]Besides, it's really quite pretty when it's falling. We all need to take a step back and enjoy the moment from time to time.","[angry]Every time a big storm rolls through, I try to convince #npc_name_lainey# to head inside and wait it out, but they never listen!///[sad]Or at the very least, not stray too far from home.///[angry]Why can't they just listen for once? One of these days it's going to cause some trouble.",[shocked]Brrrr! My fur is not nearly thick enough to keep me warm in this terrible weather! Feels like it's only getting worse and worse!,"[shocked]Woah, you doing OK there, #player_name#? I can escort you to the clinic if need be. This looks like something #npc_name_krampy# could treat.///You seriously need to watch yourself out there, OK? Your #colony_title# needs you to stay healthy.","[shocked]I think I smelled a tasty #item_name_mouse# over at #npc_name_ember#'s shop earlier. You hungry, #player_name#?","[sad]If you're here to bully me like usual, don't. I'm trying to move on with my life, OK?",[shocked]You seem busy! I'd hate to waste the time of such an important cat! Surely there are more pressing matters to attend to?,"[neutral]#npc_name_lainey# is really a good cat, you just have to dig a bit before you start to see it. If you get to know them, I promise you won't be disappointed.///[thinking]I've always known #npc_name_lainey# to be a gifted cat. They have a lot to offer #colony_title_with_article#.","[neutral]I do try to give #npc_name_lainey# their space. I want to see them grow and explore on their own, but I'll always be there for them.///[thinking]We're the same age, of course, but I sort of helped to raise #npc_name_lainey#. It was difficult for my mother to divide her attention between all seven of us as kittens, and I stepped into the role naturally.","[neutral]I'm flattered that you think I'm interesting enough to chat with. Honestly, I'm just a normal cat. I haven't had a long enough life to have interesting stories, like #npc_name_krampy# or #npc_name_coco# do.///I'm hoping this new #colony_title# business will provide me with plenty of interesting experiences. That's why I moved out here in the first place.","[thinking]#npc_name_coco# is a tough cat to figure out. They certainly seem like they have a unique upbringing, but I can't get them to talk about it.///[neutral]I'm working on it. One of these days, I'll get through to them. I just need to keep chatting with them every day and bringing tasteful gifts. Maybe that'll do it.","[neutral]My goal is to be on good terms with every cat in #colony_title_with_article#. Easier said than done, I know.///[thinking]Some are easier to get through to than others. I'm sure you've noticed. It's kind of interesting how different they all are. We sure are a ragtag bunch of felines!///[neutral]But we all moved out here for a reason. Once I can figure that out for any individual, I can really start to ask the right questions.","[playful]I'm not a bad hunter, so that's what I mainly try to focus on when I need something productive to do. It's not my favorite activity ever, but I got pretty good at it when I was little.///[thinking]It's also good because you get to be alone with your thoughts for a bit. Helps to process your thoughts and figure stuff out when you can get away from the hustle and bustle of #colony_title#-life for a while.","[shocked]Have you ever seen someone like the #npc_name_theforestguardian# before? It's clear that they are very powerful. It's exciting and scary at the same time.///[thinking]I always get the weird feeling that they know everything about me when I'm in their presence. Those eyes are haunting.///[neutral]Oh, I sure hope I'm on good terms with them. I'd hate to be on their bad side, that's for sure!","[neutral]You ever notice how a cat pounces in a beautiful arch? There's got to be a way to quantify the relationship between the pounce strength and the resultant arc.///[thinking]I don't have a way to express the relationship just yet, but I'm working on it. Maybe someday I'll have it down.","[happy]I really appreciate that you take some time out of your day to ask how I'm doing. It shows a lot about your character, #player_name#. I know that under your leadership, #colony_title_with_article# is in good paws.///[neutral]I wish every cat were as thoughtful as you!","[neutral]You can lay out six [green]mice[/green] and start to count them. One, two, three, four, five, six.///[thinking]But what if you have multiple groupings of [green]mice[/green]? Surely there is some way to count them up quickly. See, what if we took our six [green]mice[/green] and divided them into three groups of two?///[happy]Oh, sorry. I must be boring you. #npc_name_lainey# tells me I can get a bit abstract at times.","[neutral]I spend an hour every day picking up debris along #colony_title_with_article# pathways and cleaning up their edges. It's a small thing, but I want to live in a tidy, sharp-looking town.///[happy]Besides, it gives me something productive to do. If we all spent some time every day making sure things were in order, #colony_title_with_article# would always look shiny and new.","[neutral]It must be hard to be #leader_title_with_article#. I don't envy your position. There are certainly hard choices you have to make that not every cat will agree with.///[thinking]As long as we all have faith in your ability to see what's best, we'll be just fine.","[neutral]I once read a rumor about an ancient amulet called a #power_paw#. According to the myth, it's a magical artifact from antiquity with powerful properties.///[neutral]Supposedly there are many hidden throughout the world, but their locations is a closely-guarded secret. Isn't that exciting, #player_name#? If the rumors are true, it'd be like a real-life treasure hunt!","[neutral]It can be hard to keep up with #npc_name_lainey# sometimes. They have so much energy, you know? Even tracking them down is a challenge.///[playful]But no matter how hard it can be, it's worth it. They're family, and family is important. I can't imagine a world without my dearest sibling.","[neutral]Some day I would love to open an academy and teach others the basics of research and how to study the natural world.///[thinking]I don't have any qualifications, but pouring myself into others is my calling. I think it's my purpose in life. Does that make sense to you?","[neutral]They say in order to be a good hunter, you have to have a good nose. That can be a learned skill, by the way. If you study your desired prey's scent, you may be able to sniff them out from quite a distance.///[neutral]One of my younger siblings always loved [green]Shrews[/green], which can be a bit tricky to catch. I spent hours training my nose to recognize the tantalizing fragrance of a [green]Shrew[/green].///[happy]Now, if one walks by within a half a mile, I always know it.",[thinking]I've never lived in a #colony_title# before. It's so lovely to have a community of cats to rely on. Living out on your own with just you and your family is a hard life.///[happy]Now I can wander around and feel safe because I know the borders are being watched. I can spend the day without worrying about hunting because #npc_name_ember# will always have something in stock. I can visit the clinic if I sprain my paw.///[neutral]It's important to be conscious of the good things you have in life. Gratitude is key to a fulfilling life.,"[happy]You're always so chipper, #player_name#. I'd love to learn your secret. I wish every cat in #colony_title_with_article# could be just like you. Such a capable, confident cat!///[thinking]Maybe you can teach #npc_name_lainey# a thing or two as well. They could really use some manners.","[neutral]I've been told I'm a pretty even-keeled cat. I don't tend to lose my cool often, you know what I mean? I think the reason is that I just get so lost in my own head sometimes.///[playful]There's so much to think about! To analyze! To study! I don't know what I would even do with my time if I wasn't always thinking about something.","[sad]I've been thinking about our relationship a lot lately, if you couldn't tell. The problem is that every time I think about it, I end up sadder than I was before. Why do you think that might be?","[neutral]Dating is such an interesting prospect. There's so much psychology involved in the whole thing. I find it's easier to analyze my friends' relationships than my own.///[blushing]When your own feelings are involved, things are so much more real, so much more complicated! No matter how much you know in theory, it feels different in practice when it's your own life. Funny how that works!","[happy]You look lovely today, #player_name#. Just in case no cat has ever told you this before, you're quite good looking. But I'd imagine you hear that often enough!","[blushing]I think I'm still pretty giddy about this dating business. I woke up this morning, forgot about the whole thing, and slowly realized that I'm in a relationship with you. Gives me the chills! How exciting this all is!","[neutral]What's the most romantic place you know of? I'd love to pack a picnic and spend the day with you there. I have a few places in mind, but I want to see your favorite spots first.","[neutral]I'm never bored talking to you. You always have something interesting to share, or there's something new to learn about you.///[thinking]What was your life like as a kitten? Surely you must have some fun memories. It can be anything, even a tiny, unimportant-seeming memory.///[neutral]I just want to get to know you as best I possibly can. I find you fascinating, #player_name#.","[thinking]I hope it doesn't bother you that I still spend so much time with #npc_name_lainey#. They're my family, and always will be. We've been practically inseparable our entire lives. I care deeply about them.///[blushing]But I still want to spend as much time as possible with you, #player_name#!","[happy][purr]Oh #player_name#, the funniest thing happened yesterday! I'm still laughing about it. #npc_name_lainey# tried to hide in a tree and scare #npc_name_ember#. I told them not to, but they didn't listen, like usual.///[playful]Anyways, #npc_name_ember# came around the corner and was about to open up the shop, so I expected #npc_name_lainey# to jump out of the tree and scare them. But they didn't!///[happy]#npc_name_lainey# got stuck in the tree and couldn't get down, so I had to help them down. #npc_name_ember# saw me doing it and joined in, then #npc_name_lainey# had to explain what they were up to.///[happy]Isn't that hilarious? Justice served! I wish you could've been there to see it happen.","[neutral]It's certainly improved my social standing to be dating #leader_title_with_article# of #colony_full_name_with_article#. I've noticed most cats are a little bit more friendly towards me, which is kind of nice but also kind of sad.///[shocked]I wish they could just be themselves around me! I want to know them all personally, but it's hard to do that when they can't see past your title and my relationship to you, #player_name#.///[thinking]Comes with the territory, I suppose.","[happy]...Oh, did you say something? Sorry. I got a little lost in my thoughts thinking about you.///[blushing]...Oh, that's very embarrassing! I shouldn't have said anything. Forget it!","[neutral]I was thinking about going out on a little hunting expedition. Care to tag along, #player_name#? I always have a better time out and about when you're right there with me.","[happy]I've always known from a very young age that I wanted to meet a nice cat and fall in love with them. I had all sorts of ideas of what that might look like, but they all seem so silly now.///[playful]I had no idea what love was actually like, so I made stuff up in my head. I thought I had it all figured out, but the experience of actually dating you has blown my expectations out of the water.///[thinking]You know what I mean, #player_name#? Surely you did the same thing, right? Or am I just weird like that?","[neutral]I know you've always got a ton of stuff on your to-do list, #player_name#. It must keep you very busy being #leader_title_with_article#.///[shocked]If there's anything I can do, please just let me know. I want to support you as best as I'm able!","[playful]I've got a great idea for a gift for you, but I want it to be a surprise. I've just got to track one down first...///[happy]Nope, no amount of begging is going to make me reveal what I have planned! You'll just have to find out when you find out.","[happy][purr]I missed you a lot. I'm glad you came by. I was just thinking about you as I was out hunting.///[blushing]I might have missed a big, juicy [green]Trout[/green] because I got a bit lost thinking about you. You ever have that happen? It's a new experience for me.","[neutral]You lead a pretty dangerous life, #player_name#. Lots of fights and adventures to far off places. I'm guessing that would freak some cats out, but I trust you to make good decisions and know your own limitations.///[thinking]After all, what is a relationship if it's not built on mutual trust? I know you can figure things out on your own. You're strong, capable, and smart. You make me very proud.","[happy]So, while taking a nap in the sun, I dreamed that we grew old together. I wouldn't mind that at all.///[blushing]Doesn't that sound nice, #player_name#? Just you and me 'til the end of time. What a lovely thought.","[happy][purr]I don't know what it is about you, but I can't help but purr when you are near. That's got to be a good sign.","[happy][purr]I have been wanting to ask you something...///[blushing]Well, never mind. I... Forgot it.","[playful]Wow, did you do something different with your fur? You look great today.///[blushing]Not that you don't look great every day! You know what I meant.","[neutral]You make me strangely confident, #player_name#. If I can be with a cat as awesome as you, then I can do anything! It's a lovely thought.///[happy]It's probably because you're so supportive of my dreams. I'm very grateful to be in a relationship with you, #player_name#. You're the best!","[sad]Not right now. I need some time to be alone with my thoughts to process my emotions. Please, find someone else to bother for a while.","[neutral]I'm trying to write down my thoughts more these days. Now that the wedding is done and out of the way I have more time to spend with my thoughts.///[thinking]I think I can find a way to write instructional material, but I haven't perfected it just yet.///[shocked]Oh, by the way, if you stumble across my writings, don't read them yet! They're not finished!",[blushing]You're always so thoughtful. You prepared the den for me and everything. I feel very comfortable living here!,"[happy]I know we're married and it's exciting and all, but I totally understand that you've got stuff to do. Go do what you've got to do for the day, then we can spend some time together. I'm rooting for you!","[neutral]Don't tell #npc_name_lainey#, but I'm starting to feel like I know you just as well as them. I love learning new things about you and your past, #player_name#.","[playful]If you're ever having a rough day, you can come to me and tell me about it, #player_name#. You don't have to pretend like you're tough and nothing gets to you. You can do that with the rest of #colony_title_with_article#.///[neutral]But I'm your spouse, and I want to help when things are getting hard for you, OK?","[neutral]I saw a very interesting bug today that I'd never seen before. I'm going to track it and document its behavior if I stumble across it again.///[thinking]I had to run back to the den to fetch a pad of paper to jot down my notes, and it scurried away before I could return.","[neutral]It's important that we keep the den nice and organized. It's no good if we mix the food in with the flowers. It'll make the flowers go bad sooner than they would otherwise, and I like how they make the den smell.","[playful]Did you bring me anything new? I love seeing what different things you find. You must stumble across some pretty unique items out in the wilderness when you head out past the borders!///[neutral]It certainly keeps life interesting. That's a great thing, #player_name#. You've got great scouting skills, and you should know it!","[neutral]I have a lot of respect for #npc_name_krampy#. Science takes hard work and perseverance to see an experiment through to the end. Some cats might think they're kind of crazy, but I think I can see past their quirks.///[happy]I always walk away from my conversations with #npc_name_krampy# having learned something new!","[happy]I've never lived without a roommate. First it was #npc_name_lainey#, and now it's you #player_name#! That's nice. I don't know that I would do very well living alone.///[thinking]I think I would get really bored, really fast. Having someone else in the den keeps the energy high.","[playful]It's very comfortable living with you, #player_name#. You aren't as noisy as #npc_name_lainey# when you get up in the morning!///[neutral]I'm used to a lot of commotion, so it's a nice change of pace. No more running through the den with wet paws or knocking over the furniture.","[blushing]I was just thinking about when we started dating. I'd like to forget some of the embarrassing things I said, I hope you don't remember them all.///[shocked]There's a bunch of new things to figure out when you get into a relationship. Nobody prepares you for that.",[happy]I feel so safe when you're around. I feel like a rabid [green]Weasel[/green] could sprint straight into our den and it wouldn't get anywhere close to me because you'd stop it first. That's such a good feeling.,"[neutral]Marriage sure does add a lot of responsibility to life, doesn't it? It's different when you have to start thinking about supporting someone other than yourself. I'd always had #npc_name_lainey# to worry about, but it must be somewhat new to you #player_name#.///[happy]As with all things in life, it's all about balance! Juggling a marriage alongside all the tasks that come with being #leader_title_with_article# must keep you very busy indeed.","[thinking]Family is the most important thing to me. It doesn't matter what else is going on my life. It's my top priority.///[happy]And now, you're my family, #player_name#!","[neutral]I'm trying my best to learn what all the different plants that grow in the forest are. I've been talking to #npc_name_krampy# about it. That cat is very knowledgeable about the ones with healing properties.///[thinking]I've thought about starting a catalog of herbs, with hand-drawn pictures and a short description of each. Do you think that would be useful to anybody if I wrote it down?","[neutral]There was a small hole in the den wall that was letting a nasty draft through. Kept me up last night because it was blowing right on me. I spent most of the morning patching it up, but I ran out of twigs.///[thinking]I'm sure I can track some more down before the end of the day. If I don't, I'm not sure I'll get much shut-eye tonight.","[playful]Do you think every cat is destined to find someone, like we found each other? It's a lovely thought. I'm not sure I believe it myself, but I'd like to.///[shocked]There's a bunch of different cats out there, so who knows? Even the strangest cats can probably find someone they're compatible with.","[neutral]I used to have dreams about living in a den like ours with a cat like you. I would wake up with the strongest sense of longing, like I knew it was going to be my future but I hadn't quite reached it yet. I wanted it so bad.///[thinking]It's lovely that I get to live my dreams out in my everyday life.","[happy]I love big families. When everybody gets together, there's so many cats to catch up with! You never run out of someone to hang out with. That's how my family was growing up, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.","[happy]Hey #player_name#, you're a parent now! How does it feel? Must be pretty different than how things were before, huh?///[shocked]I mean it in a good way! I'll bet it's really nice to be able to come home to a big loving family.///[happy]I know a thing or two about that. My family growing up was [i]huuuuge[/i]! It makes me feel all warm inside just thinking about it.","[thinking]It's rare that I get mad at #npc_name_lainey#, but it does happen. Most recently it happened when they tried to pull a prank on #npc_name_talon#.///[shocked]#npc_name_talon# came over and started yelling at me thinking I was #npc_name_lainey#. It was so scary!",[playful]#npc_name_elli# is actually a really great cat. Just a little jumpy at times.///[happy]They helped #npc_name_lainey# and I get out of a bramble thicket once. We were really stuck!,"[thinking]I'm really starting to get comfortable here. I think I've found my niche. It's a good life.///[neutral]We've got such a kind community to rely on. I'd like to think that I do my part to ensure that everyone else feels comfortable here, too.","[neutral]Nighttime is when I do my best writing. I try to set aside an hour before bed for jotting down my thoughts.///[shocked]I was just about to figure out how to advance the plot for my latest story but then I lost it.///[happy]Oh well, I'll probably remember tomorrow after a good night's rest.","[thinking]I know it must seem strange from an outsider's perspective, but I rarely go anywhere without #npc_name_lainey#. We're practically inseparable.///[neutral]I know some cats aren't as close with their siblings. I think that's sad! #npc_name_lainey# is my best friend. I can't imagine life without them.",[neutral]I hope that #npc_name_lainey# is doing well today. I have less time to check up on them since I got married.,[blushing]I was honestly a little worried that I would have to help #npc_name_alabaster# with gardening when we got married.///[happy]Luckily #npc_name_alabaster# is very self-sufficient! We both have our hobbies and know how to take care of our own needs. It's nice.,"[thinking]Did I ever tell you about when #npc_name_alabaster# asked me to get married?///[blushing]Along with the [green]Shiny Trinket[/green], #npc_name_alabaster# gave me a dozen [green]Red Roses[/green]!///[blushing]#npc_name_alabaster# grew them in the garden just to give to me.///[shocked]I don't know how they fit so many stems in their mouth!","[blushing]Everything changes when you become a parent, huh? My priorities sure have shifted.///[neutral]The thing that I want most for #npc_name_salem# is that they grow up with the same kind of loving family that I had when I was a kid.///[blushing]I'm doing everything I can to provide that for them.",,[happy]Everyone can use some encouragement from time to time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[thinking]I know sometimes #npc_name_lainey# can be goofy, but I really do think they're going to make an awesome parent.

That's what makes them so great.///[playful]I'm glad you two found each other. Plus, having a den all to myself is pretty nice, not gonna lie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well, I'll certainly try my best, ok?","[thinking]I feel like I learned something today while we were adventuring.///[happy]You're a good pal, #player_name#. It's nice to have a buddy to hang out with.","[shocked]Phew, adventuring is harder than it looks! But I'll get it figured out.

That's mean, and you know it.","[happy]I didn't have high expectations for my [rainbow]birthday[/rainbow]. Nobody used to give me anything.///[happy]But this is great! Thank you, #player_name#. I'll be sure to find a use for it.","[playful]Oh hey, it's a #last_item_given#? It wasn't on my list, but I'll take it. Thanks.","[neutral]You tried, and I appreciate that.

My paws are full and I'm sure I'll lose it if I take it.","[thinking]I think I dropped a #gift_item# somewhere around here. Oh, there it is.///[neutral]Do you want it, #player_name#? You'll probably take better care of it than I could. It deserves better.","[shocked]You came around a lot quicker than I was expecting. I didn't even have time to wrap this #gift_item# up.

Anyways, I'll shut up and let you go on with your life now.///[sad]Don't let me stop you.","[blushing]That was almost funny, #player_name#, but we all know you didn't mean it. It's kind of a cruel prank to play on someone like me.///[thinking]You should probably think more before you go and ruin somebody's day.","[angry]Hey, what gives? That's not funny #player_name#. You're already committed.///[sad]Or maybe you're less committed than I thought... What a terrible thing to do to #player_significant_other_name#.","[thinking]It's rude to walk around with that thing. I couldn't afford one if I saved for a year, and here you are with an extra one.///[sad]Maybe give it to someone who will appreciate it, like #player_significant_other_name#?","[shocked]Woah, how did you afford something like that? Oh, right, you're #leader_title_with_article#. I forgot.","[sad]Oh, I'm terrible with flowers. They always seem to die.

You're sure you want to do that?///[thinking]If this is for me, then that means... No, that can't be. Is it true..?///[happy]You like me, don't you #player_name#? Well that's a shocker. Can't say that I saw this coming. Nobody's ever given me one of these before.///[blushing]I... uh... Yeah, I'll admit it. I like you too, #player_name#. I have for a while now.

I tried to shoulder it as best I could for as long as I could, but I need to be honest with myself.///[sad]I'm even more miserable than normal. Everything was wonderful until we got married. Now everything is terrible. Worse than it was before I met you...///[thinking]I've had a lot of time to think things over and I'm pretty sure I made a mistake. I knew I couldn't handle a serious relationship, but I got into one anyways. I'm so stupid.///[angry]I can't do anything right. Especially a marriage. So I'm leaving. I'd imagine you'll get over it some day, #player_name#. You deserve someone better than me, ok?///[sad]You can't really change my mind. Not even I can do that. I tried my best, ok?

I'm sure there are more comfortable places...","[blushing]I was just thinking about you, and then you walked in the door. Weird, huh?","[sad]I'm pretty sure your den is nicer than this. We should go there instead, yeah?","[angry]Can't believe I'm up this early! The birds wouldn't stop chirping outside and I couldn't fall back to sleep, so here I am.///[angry]I'm cranky, but here I am.","[thinking]My brain is going at half speed. I need more sleep than this.///[sad]I always promise myself I'll go to bed earlier and then fail to follow through. Ah, shoot. I should just give up trying...","[neutral]I'm awake this early because I had a dream that I can't get off my mind. I wish I could put it to the side and close my eyes and drift off again, but I can't.///[angry]Stupid dream! Keeping me awake and on my toes. If I have to be awake then I'm going to grumble about it to anyone that will listen.","[thinking]It's darker than normal tonight, yeah? Weird. Must mean something, but I'm not smart enough to figure it out...","[sad]I wanted to go to bed hours ago, but my stomach keeps growling and so I need to find something to eat. But all the critters are already asleep. Darn.///[angry]Maybe I should have spent some time this evening hunting instead of slacking off. I never learn. I'll figure it out eventually...",[neutral]I seriously thought you were someone else when you were approaching in the dark. My eyes are awful. That's why I'm a bad hunter.,"[sad]I know I should be using this lovely day to do something productive, but I'm in a bad mood today. I feel like I've been stuck in a rut for months.///[angry]I wish I weren't so useless to #colony_title_with_article#!","[angry]My eyesight's already bad, I didn't need this fog to roll in and make my vision worse! It's like the whole universe is conspiring against me.///[sad]Fine, I get it. I should just stay inside and get out of the way. What else is new?","[sad]Hrmph! I just finished bathing myself and drying off, then this horrible downpour started. That's how things always seem to go for poor #npc_name_garlic#.///[shocked]No, no sunny days for me! Just nasty, overcast, rainy ones.",[shocked]I don't think I've ever been this cold before! I'm sure I'd be in pain if my paws weren't already numb.///[sad]Do you think it will ever stop snowing? I'm over this winter business. I want life to go back to normal.,"[playful]You ever take a walk in the woods while the thunder is rolling? I don't know why, but there's something about it that I like.///[happy]Maybe a tree will crack and break in the wind and fall over and I'll have to leap out of the way.///[thinking]Sounds plenty exciting to me.","[shocked]Oh, this is the end, isn't it? It's the worst winter I've ever seen. These snowstorms are different out here in the Wildwood.///[angry]We'll all be buried in five feet of snow! When the springtime rolls around, there won't be any cats here to greet it. Oh no...","[sad]Oh, you look kind of beat up. I know how that feels. You'll get used to it.","[thinking]If you're coming around to beg for a meal, you've come to the wrong cat. I'd take a free meal if I could get one too. Sorry.","[sad]I... uh, I forgot what I was going to say. Darn it, #npc_name_garlic#, you can't even talk right...",[thinking]You probably don't want to hang around me too long. I've been told I bring the energy down. I'm sure it's all true.///[neutral]Not that your energy is much better. I can feel your disapproval. No need to verbalize it. I already know all about it.,"[sad]Some cats never catch a break, and I'm one of them. Life has a way of beating you down, and it's hard to find a way to stand back up again.///[angry]That's ok though, it's more comfortable down on the ground anyways. I'll stay low so I don't get knocked down again...","[neutral]Oh, shoot. Now I have to think of something to talk about...///[sad]It's not nice to put so much social pressure on someone else. I was already in a bad mood, and now I feel even worse.///[thinking]I don't blame you for not noticing though. I'm always frowning.","[sad]I've tried about every trick in the book to get moving and get motivated, but nothing seems to work.///[thinking]Getting up early? Too tired. Exercise before eating breakfast? Too hungry. Reward yourself with a snack? Too much of a hassle to catch something in advance.///[sad]I think I'll always be down in the dumps. Not that you would care about that. Sorry for unloading on you like that.///[neutral]I'll go find a tree to talk to.","[sad]My front paw has been hurting all morning. I think I slept on it wrong.///[thinking]You'd think I'd have figured out how to sleep properly by now. I do it all the time. But no, I'm not that smart I guess...","[angry]It must be so tiring to have the weight of #colony_title_with_article# on your shoulders. It would wear me down to nothing, I think...///[sad]I suppose someone's got to do it, and it's best that someone like you does it and not someone like me.///[neutral]I get all tuckered out from watching you run around town... No way I would ever do that myself.","[sad]#npc_name_coco# told me it's not safe to wander far from town. Something about scary shadow figures lurking in the shadows, waiting to pounce on unsuspecting cats like me.///[thinking]That's more than enough reason to stay put and shelter in place. No reason to go sticking your nose where it don't belong.///[angry]That's a good way to get yourself hurt.","[sad]My paw is acting up today. It hurts worse than yesterday. I don't know what I did to it but it's not very happy right now.///[thinking]I went to #npc_name_krampy# to get it checked out and they gave me some herbs to wrap around it, but I don't think they're doing much.///[sad]#npc_name_krampy# told me they couldn't see anything wrong with my paw, but I don't know. I'll bet they gave me a bunch of common grasses and weeds instead of real medicine.///[angry]Oh, everyone's out to get me, I just know it...","[thinking]I hope you're grateful for your good eyesight, #player_name#. You don't want to be like me and have everything look like a colorful blur.///[sad]Maybe I'd stand a chance of being useful around here if I could see what's going on a little better, but that's life. It isn't fair, and especially not to me.","[shocked]I know it's not a very large town, but there's some cats I still haven't bothered to meet yet. I see them walking around and we mostly just ignore each other.///[sad]Besides, I'm sure they wouldn't like me. I'll probably keep to myself...","[thinking]Between you and me, I can't stand #npc_name_spark#. They're always so cheery and full of energy. It really annoys me.///[angry]How can any cat be that peppy? It's all a show. Nobody is really that happy.","[shocked]Oh, I'm a wreck right now... I have a little pebble that I carry around everywhere with me.///[thinking]When I get stressed out I like to rub circles around the pebble with my paw.///[angry]It's gone missing! I can't find it anywhere. I'm sure I misplaced it and forgot where I put it. Shoot, #npc_name_garlic#, you've really done it this time...","[sad]What's the point of planning ahead when nothing goes according to your plan anyways?///[shocked]My day was going great until I wandered into that thorny bush. Now everything's ruined.///[angry]I spent the last hour picking thorns out of my fur, now my whole schedule's off track. Might as well call it a day and give up.","[thinking]Hey, what's your secret? You really do believe in yourself, don't you? I've got to admit, when we first met I thought you were faking it.///[playful]It must be nice to have that sort of trust in your abilities. If you figure out how you did it, let me know, ok?","[neutral]I don't know what you're so happy about. Something about that smile is really bothering me.///[sad]Sorry, it's not your fault you're happy. It's my own problem. I don't know why it annoys me, but it does.","[thinking]Well, you're still coming around to say hello. That must mean that you like spending time with me. I can't imagine why.///[happy]But it does cheer me up a bit to see you come around. Don't stop dropping by, ok #player_name#? Thanks.","[neutral]I'm not the most ambitious cat in the world. As a matter of fact, I don't think I have any ambition whatsoever. I don't see the appeal.///[sad]Setting goals sounds like a great way to let yourself down. If there's one thing I need less of, it's disappointment in myself.///[thinking]Hey, there's a goal, right? Trying to not let myself down as much? Eh, it's a start.","[sad]Oh, don't mind my frown. It's not you, I promise. I'm having another down day. It happens from time to time. Most of the time, actually.///[neutral]It used to be a lot worse. I think I took some time to adjust after moving out here.///[shocked]Sometimes I still miss my old life. I think that's what gets my mood all screwed up.///[neutral]I'll get over it. It helps to have someone to talk to so that I can process my emotions. Thanks, #player_name#.","[happy]I can't put my paw on it, but for some reason today feels like it's going to be a good day. What a strange feeling.///[neutral]Maybe my luck will take a turn for the better.","[shocked]Ah, darn it. The fur on the side of my head is all matted again. Right where I can't reach it.///[angry]Curse this long hair... Short-haired cats have it so much easier. They don't know what it's like to be me.","[angry]Hey, I'm really trying, ok?? This is one of the few things in my life that I've really poured my all into, and it's still failing.///[sad]That figures! Everything I touch dies. Even relationships...","[blushing]Wow, I've got to admit, I'm feeling some new feelings I've never felt before. It's jumbling my brain!///[shocked]I swear, I had something I wanted to talk about with you, but now it's gone. My brain's all twisted up. Hrmph!","[playful]You look well.///[shocked]I mean good! You look good.///[thinking]You look both good and well.///[blushing]Ahhhgggh, that sounds weird. You know what I meant.","[playful]Hey, I cleaned up my fur in case you came by. Here you are! What do you think?///[neutral]I styled it a bit different than usual. Can you tell?///[blushing]Oh, I knew it was too subtle! I barely changed anything to be honest. I'm a creature of habit. I don't do change, so when I mix it up I only go halfway in.///[shocked]Argh, I knew it was a mistake. What was wrong with my style before? Absolutely nothing. Hrmph.","[shocked]You've given me so many things that I'm having a hard time figuring out where to put them all.///[blushing]I'm not asking you to stop! I love your gifts. They're nice.///[shocked]Oh, I shouldn't have said anything. I don't want you to feel bad about being nice. You didn't do anything wrong...","[sad]It's nice to have someone who cares about me so much. It makes me feel really warm and fuzzy inside.///[shocked]Oh, was I tearing up? Sorry, it's a complicated emotion. I don't know how to explain it.///[sad]It feels like sometimes you care more about me than I care about me. You're too good to me, #player_name#.","[playful]I like how we get along. You're very pleasant to be around.///[neutral]I know I'm the exact opposite, so I don't really get why you're sticking around. I'm glad you're here.","[happy]I've got to say, I woke up thinking today was going to be gloomy and awful like usual. But things haven't really turned out that way.///[neutral]A [green]Toad[/green] practically hopped right into my paws just as I was getting hungry. Fancy that, what are the odds?///[happy]Then you showed up and things are even better.","[sad]My darn paw is acting up again today. Could you hold it for a bit? I think that would make it feel better.///[blushing]Yep, that feels better already. Thanks, #player_name#.","[shocked]Oh no... Oh no oh no... I picked out a great present for you but I seem to have misplaced it. Typical #npc_name_garlic#...///[shocked]Oh, you want to know what it was? No, I'm not going to tell you! What if it shows up tomorrow?? I can't spoil the surprise.","[thinking]Is there something on my face? Feels like every cat has been giving me a weird look today.///[blushing]Oh, shoot! How long was that leaf lodged in there? That's so embarrassing...///[sad]You must be so embarrassed to have me around. I'm sorry #player_name#. I'm trying my best...///[shocked]What, you don't think so? Oh, you really mean it?///[happy]...Thanks, #player_name#. I feel a little better.","[angry]You have time to listen to me rant for a bit? I'm having another one of those days.///[sad]I was stalking a tasty little [green]Toad[/green] when it hopped onto a big lilypad in the river.///[thinking]I snuck right up to the riverbank so that I could sneakily watch if it came back ashore. Would have made for a nice meal, you know?///[sad]That's when my foot slipped and I tumbled into the river. All the noise and the splashing scared the [green]Toad[/green] off of course, and then I was dripping wet.///[angry]I only recently had the chance to sit out and dry for a bit. I think I'm going to call it a day and head back to bed or something...","[neutral]Hey, #player_name#. If I ever snap at you, I want you to know in advance it's not personal. I probably don't even mean it.///[angry]I get in such a funk sometimes! It's hard to shake it. You ever have that happen to you?","[playful]I'm not even sure how we got to this point. It felt like every other cat was actively avoiding me, but not you.///[happy]You kept coming back day after day and being kind and thoughtful and generous. Now look at us! We're a couple. Wild, huh?///[neutral]I wonder what's next? Guess we'll find out.","[sad]My biggest fear in life is letting others down. Now that we're dating, that feeling is amplified with you!///[shocked]I can't imagine what it would be like if I let you down. I couldn't let that happen.///[sad]But you'd forgive me if I did, right?///[happy]I'll do my best, I promise. Thanks for the reassurance. It helps a lot.","[neutral]Hey, I have a tough time opening up, so try not to laugh, ok?///[thinking]I've been doing some thinking lately and I believe I've had a revelation about myself.///[neutral]I like to project an image of myself as unattached and uncaring so that others will stay at arm's length and won't get close to me.///[shocked]But the truth of the matter is, I care! I care a lot! Especially about you.///[thinking]I'm afraid others will see that trait in me and use it against me. Or that I'll screw it all up and betray them.///[blushing]Does that make any sense? I don't know... I'm probably ranting again. Sorry.","[neutral]If I'm being honest, I'd always assumed I'd have to make it alone. Be an island, put up walls, don't let anybody in.///[thinking]I don't seem to get along with others easily, so I figured I was meant to be by myself.///[blushing]When you came along, it felt like the ground was shifting. I had to wrestle with the idea that maybe I was wrong? Maybe we were meant to be together?///[shocked]I'm still trying to put the pieces together.","[playful]Oh, you smell nice today! Did you rub some herbs in your fur or something?///[thinking]There's an old saying about that... How does it go again?///[blushing]Hrmph... I can't remember! Darn it. It'll come back to me eventually.","[shocked]Phew, I'm sleepy today. I must have slept wrong.///[thinking]Oh, I remember what happened. My paw was bothering me all night. It wouldn't let me fall asleep.///[angry]Every time I'd be close to drifting up it would twitch and hit me in the face!///[sad]Maybe I'll go take a long nap. I could use it.","[happy]I stopped by the shop to pick up something to eat, and #npc_name_ember# gave me a [green]Portobello[/green]! Free of charge.///[playful]What a kind thing to do.","[sad]I think I'm going to head over to #npc_name_krampy#'s place to get my eyes checked out. They won't stop watering.///[thinking]Do you think it's pollen?///[angry]Whatever it is, it's super annoying!","[sad]I don't know... I can't think of a way to express my feelings right now. I'm frustrated.///[angry]Please go work on something else for a while. I need space, ok?","[shocked]Everything has been so busy lately! That was some wedding, huh?///[thinking]I'm glad things are calming down. I had more than my share of excitement for a while.///[happy]Now we can spend time together in peace, without cats breathing down our necks all the time. It's nice.","[playful]Your den is nice. I was worried I'd have a difficult time adjusting to living in a new environment, but so far so good.///[happy]Last night I fell right asleep. That usually doesn't happen if I don't sleep in my bed. Weird, huh?///[neutral]I think it's because I feel comfortable and safe around you.","[happy]I'm sure you have a ton of stuff to do. I won't keep you long, ok #player_name#?///[shocked]Oh, me? ...Uh, I haven't sat down with my calendar yet. I'm still figuring it out...///[angry]Hey, I won't just sit around! I promise. I'll find something to do... Like... uh, sorting the mail? I don't know.",[blushing]Can you help me with my fur? The tufts on the side of my face keep getting all gross and dirty and I can't reach them.///[playful]I'll return the favor sometime. How's about that?,"[happy]I've got to admit, I think some of your cheeriness is rubbing off on me. I woke up with a smile on my face today.///[shocked]I didn't like it! What a strange feeling. I'm never happy to be woken up.","[sad]Well, if there's one thing I've learned about myself, it's that I am definitely not a morning cat. I used to sleep in more than I do now.///[shocked]But I have to take care of you now! I can't sleep my life away. I've got to get up and get going!///[playful]I'll get used to it. Give me some time in the mornings to get around. And some space. I'm usually pretty cranky.","[neutral]I thought I'd have to move some furniture around when I moved in to your den, but that hasn't been the case thankfully.///[happy]It's all working out just fine.","[shocked]Oh, shoot. I think I was sleep-walking last night. Did I wake you up? Sorry.///[angry]I must have been hungry because I found some crumbs on the ground around the bed. Whoops.///[neutral]I'll clean it up, don't worry. You go about your day. I'll tidy up.","[playful]Hey, #player_name#. Did you know that you snore?///[shocked]I didn't know any cat could snore so loudly!///[playful]I'm just messing with you. It's fine. I don't mind it all that much. I wanted to see your reaction.","[sad]I was batting at a fly that wouldn't leave me alone, and I must have scratched my nose with one of my claws. It really hurts!///[blushing]Maybe you could give it a kiss and make it feel better? If you want to. You don't have to!","[happy]Do I seem like I'm in a good mood? That's because I am.///[playful]I decided last night that I'm taking the day off. I'm not going to do anything the whole day! Doesn't that sound delightful?///[happy]You're welcome to join me. You should take a break every once in a while, #player_name#.","[shocked]I can see it in your eyes, #player_name#. You're planning to venture off to somewhere dangerous and get into a whole bunch of trouble, aren't you??///[angry]Be careful, ok? I need you around here. I don't know what I would do without you.///[thinking]I know you have to do what you have to do. But think of me before you take any big risks, alright? That's all I'm asking.","[sad]Yuck, I've got a hairball stuck in my throat that doesn't want to come out. That's the worst.///[angry]I'd rather just puke it up and get it over with! Then I could move on with my life.///[shocked]You might not want to stand there, #player_name#! Wouldn't want you caught in the crossfire when it happens.","[happy]When I was young I used to have a big [green]seashell[/green] collection. I had every kind of shell you could imagine. Pink ones, red ones, even iridescent ones.///[shocked]My parents made me throw it out because it started to stink up the den. Nowadays I make sure to clean anything I find in the river before I bring it inside.///[happy]Did you ever collect anything, #player_name#?","[neutral]I feel very fortunate to live in #colony_full_name_with_article#. All of us have it pretty good.///[playful]Plus, #leader_title_with_article# is a very nice cat. Love you, #player_name#.","[sad]I had the scariest dream last night! I was wandering around town and I couldn't find you anywhere.///[thinking]I started asking cats where you went, and nobody had even heard of you. It was like I imagined our whole relationship. Everyone acted like I had lost it.///[angry]I was so darn angry! I'm still a little mad about it.///[happy]I'm glad you're still here. I don't know what I would do without you.","[blushing]Is there anything I can do around the den today? I want to be helpful. I don't have a lot on my schedule.///[shocked]If you can't think of anything, don't worry! I'll figure it out on my own.///[neutral]Or maybe I could come with you? As long as you aren't going anywhere too scary. I'll let you be the judge of that.","[happy]Cats are a little nicer to me than they used to be. I think it's because they respect you so much, #player_name#.///[neutral]You don't hear what they say when you're not around, but I do. Seems like everyone believes in you. I understand why. You're pretty great, #player_name#.","[angry]Shoot, my paws are caked in mud. I knew I shouldn't have walked through that puddle. It's going to take forever to clean them out!///[neutral]Well, it will give me something to do, I guess.","[neutral]I swear I smelled a [green]Frog[/green] earlier when I was walking around town... It must have gone into hiding.///[angry]Critters like that usually avoid the area. I think they can sense all the cats around. That [green]Frog[/green] must be pretty dumb.///[happy]If you happen to find it, let me know, ok? It's making me hungry.",[shocked]I was going to spend some alone time to relax and process my thoughts when all of a sudden I saw #npc_name_kittenone# bounding up over the horizon.///[sad]They talked for what seemed like hours! Does that kitten ever shut up? I didn't know what to do so I just sat there and listened.///[shocked]Who knew a kitten could have that much energy??,"[shocked]Hey, have you talked to #npc_name_glimmer# recently? Last time I walked by they were murmuring something under their breath about the end of the world.///[angry][hiss]That's scary, right? Do you think they meant... our world??","[neutral]I know that everybody has their own opinion about #npc_name_krampy#, but that cat is alright by me.///[thinking]They're one of the only cats who will listen to me complain for an hour without running away.///[happy]I know I can be a bit much but #npc_name_krampy# never interrupts or makes fun of me. They deserve a promotion or something, I don't know.",[thinking]I take a lot of naps. I even write them down in my calendar so I won't forget to lay down for a couple minutes. It helps me to stay focused and alert.///[sad]On days like today when there's so much pollen going around I even like to start my naps early and end them late. There's less pollen floating around inside.///[hiss][shocked]Achoo! Excuse me.,[shocked]Whatsit? Huh? Did I oversleep again?///[sad]Awww shoot. Now I'm going to have to go hunt on an empty stomache. Why do I always do this to myself?,"[neutral]It's always weird seeing the festival plaza empty like this. No games, no prizes, no special decor...///[happy]I like coming here on days like today because it's nice and quiet.",,,,,,[shocked]You can do it! You've got to!

When you are ready, you will be able to tap into it on a moment's notice.///[shocked]It requires much practice to get it right!","[playful]If you have heard tall tales about me from others, do not believe them! I would never dare to plot anything nefarious. This is a face you can trust, no?","[neutral]I am a collector of stories. I harvest the knowledge of others so that I may share it with all. Tell me a story from your youth, #player_name#, and I will add it to my repository.",[neutral]Your gentle spirit will win you many friends.

It takes a detailed eye to get things just right.///[shocked]I'm on my fifth draft now and there are still inaccuracies.","[thinking]I never told you this, but the day before we met I heard a whisper of your name in the middle of the night. Isn't that odd?///[playful]What do you suppose it could mean?",[blushing]Even some stars are couples. They dance with each other in an endless cycle upon the backdrop of the infinite universe.,"[neutral]In time I will reveal to you all there is to know about #npc_name_glimmer#.

After all, if we are both to become wildly famous, we will be in the public eye often.","[playful]Now that we are married, we can share the workload of making our plans come to pass. Subterfuge is a powerful tool when it is employed in the right way.","[neutral]It is as though a heavy weight was lifted from my spirit when we were married.

I'm lucky to live here with you.","[neutral]I used to race turtles when I was a kitten. I was pretty good at it, too.///[happy]The trick is to stay positive. The turtles feed off your energy.

Love you!",[happy]I love how the lights sparkle with different colors. How do you think those are powered anyways?///[shocked]I guess it doesn't matter. It's the magic of the season!,"[blushing]I was shivering a moment ago, but when you came around I suddenly warmed up. Strange.///[happy]Here's to another great year, right #player_name#?","[shocked]All I can think about is our nice, warm den!

Can you believe that?///[neutral]One swipe of my paw and it was flat on the ground. Dumb butterfly.

That feels like ages ago.","[shocked]It feels like the trees changed color overnight.

Not such a bad thing.,"[thinking]Most prey has burrowed down into the earth by now. It'll be hard to find anything to eat in all this snow. I hope you prepared.///[neutral]If not, winter will be over before you know it. The sun will come out again. It always does.",[neutral]Everything seems to slow down when the year comes to an end. It's like the whole world is waiting for things to warm up again.///[thinking]It's a nice break. There's very little activity around town.,This is #npc_name_jag#'s den. It's probably best you don't walk in uninvited until you get more acquainted.///It looks dark and cave-like inside. There's some tall pointed rocks scattered around. It doesn't seem very cozy.,"[neutral]Hey, welcome to my den. Might not be the comfiest according to most cats' standards, but it's home to me.///[thinking]I did my best to furnish it as similar to my old den as possible. I hauled all the rocks in myself from the caves. Makes me feel nostalgic somehow.","[thinking]I don't really have anywhere to sit, but you're welcome to stick around for a while as long as you're fine on your own four paws.///[neutral]Or you can lay down on the floor. I do that sometimes when I'm feeling lazy. It works.",[happy]I like visiting other cats' dens. It gives me ideas for how I can arrange my things and redecorate.///[thinking]I think it's easy to fall into a rut and forget what's possible when you're only exposed to the same space every day.,"[shocked]You know, I built most of my furniture myself. I like working with my paws when I can.///[neutral]There's something very satisfying about a job well done.","[neutral]This is my den. Is it what you expected, #player_name#?///[playful]I promise, it's safe to walk around. No traps or anything like that.

I've got quite the list of things that need done.///[blushing]Sorry, I didn't mean to sign you up for free labor.","[neutral]I'm thinking about switching out the flooring for something more modern. Dirt is fine but it gets muddy when it rains.///[thinking]What flooring do you use in your den, #player_name#? Maybe I can stop by and check it out sometime.","[happy]Yeah, those are authentic, real stalagmites! I commissioned a kind [orange]Mole[/orange] to dig around the bases and help me drag them up to my den.///[thinking]They're so heavy! I don't think they'll ever move again. They're permanent fixtures now.///[neutral]Makes me feel like I live in a real cave, like the den I grew up in.","[thinking]I never thought I'd leave my old den behind, but I didn't really have a choice.///[neutral]Most of my old hometown was destroyed in the earthquake, and what wasn't destroyed was flooded by the river when it got diverted.///[sad]My den was badly damaged. I miss it a lot.///[neutral]But hey, that's a chance at a fresh start, right? Maybe I can make this place just as memorable.","[blushing]I really need to rethink my space so that I can be a better host when you come over. Sorry, I'm not used to having company, as you can probably tell.","[shocked]If I don't wake up before the sunrise, I feel like I've wasted the whole morning.

Maybe I'll turn in early tonight to make up for it.",[thinking]Everything feels different at night. I think the brain switches into some primal mode when the moon rises.///[neutral]I'll make sure #colony_title_with_article# stays safe in the dark.

Take care of yourself, too.",[neutral]I find the moonlight very calming. Nothing helps me wind down like staying up late. It feels like all of nature is entering a restful state.,[neutral]It's a perfect day for ticking items off my list. Nothing but blue skies.///[thinking]Some cats might find the weather to be an excuse to lay around and do nothing. That sounds like nonsense to me.///[neutral]Stay productive and you'll stay happy. That's my motto.,"[angry]This is no good! There's fog everywhere. Can't see very far today. Be careful, you never know what might be hiding in the gloom.///[shocked]The sooner this fog moves out, the sooner I'll feel safe again.","[neutral]I'm not afraid of the rain. It's a free bath, essentially. Won't stop me from carrying out my duties.///[neutral]Maybe if I had less discipline, I'd retreat to my den and wait it out like some cats. I could never betray my #colony_title# like that.","[neutral]The trick to successfully staying out in the snow for a long time is to keep moving.///[thinking]I usually try to stand guard in one place for a long time, but you can't do that in the winter or else your legs will freeze like a cat popsicle.///[shocked]You only have to get that wrong once and you never will again!",[happy]Isn't this storm neat? It's like a light show in the sky. I'm going to find somewhere dry to sit back and watch for a bit.,"[shocked]Watch yourself today, #player_name#! This snowstorm isn't letting up anytime soon.

If you whittle away to nothing, what will the rest of us do?///[neutral]Plenty of prey to hunt in the wild. I'd suggest you find something fast, ok?",[thinking]You're getting in my way. I don't like cats who get in my way.///[angry]Beat it. Scram. Get lost. What more do we have to say to each other?,"[neutral]I'm going to do my best to protect #colony_title_with_article# with everything I've got.///[thinking]I dedicated my life to protecting my old hometown. I'd like to think that I was pretty good at it. Of course, the town was destroyed, and I've got to live with that guilt.///[shocked]It wasn't my fault! There's nothing you can do about an entire mountain collapsing from an earthquake. I'm trying not to take it personally.","[neutral]This is a strange place to call home. I haven't ventured out away from town much, but from what I've seen I don't want to wander too far anyways.///[shocked]Cats could get injured going off on dangerous adventures into the unknown!","[thinking]I'm grateful to you for taking me in when I left my old colony behind. I owe you one for that.///[neutral]But with #npc_name_jag#, trust must be earned! If you think we're friends just because of that, you're sadly mistaken.

If you judge me by my size, it will be your undoing.","[neutral]You're always coming around to bother me, aren't you? Don't you see that I've got better things to do than to have you talk my ear off?///[thinking]Look, that came out a bit strong, but what I'm trying to get across to you is that we can work together without getting to know each other, ok?///[neutral]The less you know about me, the better.","[shocked]Hey, next time you tell me a story, can you give me the short version? I like cats that can get to the point quickly, alright?",[thinking]Do you ever think about our old homeland? I miss it a lot. Not that there's much left to return to after the earthquake.///[neutral]I'm trying to get over it. I really am.

I am content to stay put and stay safe.,"[happy]I'll admit, I'm starting to get used to you, kid.///[thinking]Don't take it personally. I have a hard time warming up to new cats. I've been called a creature of habit by plenty of cats before.","[thinking]You seem like a cat who loves the limelight. Cats like you are always chasing down glory and fame and all that.///[neutral]I think I'd be happy if all I ever did was a job well done. I'll live my life in the background.///[thinking]If I can make everybody else's lives better, I'd call that a life well lived.","[neutral]My parents instilled in me a protective instinct.///[thinking]They told me, '#npc_name_jag#, the greatest thing you can do is to be an advocate for the weak and vulnerable.' I took their advice to heart.///[thinking]One day, our colony came under attack. A raiding party from the north descended on us like vultures in the night. They wanted our lands and our riches for themselves.///[shocked]That's when my parents sprang into action. I saw them put action to those words.///[thinking]They charged right into the fields that surrounded our town and led the invading army away long enough for the rest of us to muster our strength and prepare for the attack.///[sad]Their strategy worked, and we staved off the invasion. But my parents paid the ultimate price. They sacrificed their lives for their colony. For me.///[neutral]I will never forget what they did. I honor their legacy by defending others.

There's not a lot of cats who can say that.///[thinking]I hope that someday I can earn yours.,[thinking]No cat is able to do everything perfectly. We all rely on each other.

It's not only me that's saying that, by the way.///[thinking]I overhear almost every conversation that takes place in town. I happen to be standing around and cats happen to be talking, you know?///[neutral]Seems like everybody has nothing but good things to say about you. It takes a special cat to be so loved by your people.",[neutral]I was only a kitten when my parents passed away. They gave everything for their colony.///[shocked]I keep their memory alive by following in their footsteps.,"[sad]Hey, I've got a lot to do today, so... I'll see you tomorrow, ok?",[shocked]Isn't this something? Being a couple? I don't know much about relationships. I'll try my best.///[neutral]It's funny. I consider myself a very capable cat.

I'm not the most approachable cat around.///[neutral]You know more about me than most, but you still decided to take a chance on me?///[blushing]It's hard to believe, but I'm glad you gave me that [green]Red Rose[/green].","[playful]Any interesting rumors you've heard, #player_name#? I like to try to stay in the loop so that I can keep an eye on things.///[thinking]I figure as #leader_title_with_article# that you hear a lot of juicy stuff.","[playful]When I think about relationships, the first word that comes to mind is 'loyalty.'///[shocked]If you don't have loyalty, how can you have a relationship? It seems like the most important trait to have in all matters, romance included.///[playful]And you needn't worry about #npc_name_jag#! I am loyal to you, #player_name#. In all matters.","[blushing]Your eyes remind me of sparkling [green]fireflies[/green] dancing in a summer sunset.///[angry]Wait, never mind. Pretend I didn't say anything. I was trying something new, but now I feel all embarrassed...","[neutral]Cats used to make fun of me for my big ears.///[angry]It was all the kittens could talk about around town. 'Look at #npc_name_jag#! Careful, they'll hear you coming from miles away!'///When you're as small as I was, you have a hard time fighting off the bullies. So I decided to take my training seriously and improve myself.///[thinking]Obviously you were able to look past how I appear. I admire that about you, #player_name#.",[angry]Argh! My paws are all muddy. I was hoping to clean them off before you came by. It's so embarrassing.///[neutral]I'm trying my best. Funny how a relationship makes you want to present well.,"[neutral]I don't know what I would do if I failed #colony_title_with_article#. I don't know if I could live with myself.///[shocked]And now, failing #colony_title_with_article# would also be failing you, #player_name#.///[sad]I'll never let that happen! I swear it!","[happy]You smile a lot, #player_name#. What's up with that?///[neutral]Everybody tells me that I'm always scowling. So what if I am? Who cares?///[thinking]It's my face, I can do what I want with it.","[neutral]I was watching the outskirts of town earlier because I thought I smelled a [green]Rat[/green] sneaking around.///[neutral]Sure enough, I found its tracks. So I waited for it to rear its ugly little head so I could teach it a lesson about coming too close to #colony_title_with_article#.///[shocked]It never showed up! If I seem a bit on edge, that's probably why. I'm still on the look out for that [green]Rat[/green].///[playful]I do feel a bit calmer with you around, though. It's probably good that we had this chat so I can get my mind off it for a bit. Thanks, #player_name#.","[thinking]It feels like just yesterday that I moved in to the Wildwood. Now this place feels more like home and less like the middle of nowhere.///[blushing]Maybe that has something to do with you, #player_name#. You were very welcoming. It caught me by surprise.///[happy]You're one of the best things that ever happened to me.","[neutral]I thought I'd never get over the loss of my old colony. It's not easy switching up your life so suddenly.///[thinking]I think every cat here knows that, some more than others. I'm glad you get it, #player_name#. Makes things a lot easier.","[happy]Hey, if you want to go for a jog, take me with you! I could use the exercise.///[thinking]I usually like sticking close to town, but lately I've been wondering what all is out there. I'll bet the Wildwood is teeming with cool stuff to find.","[playful]If you're ever going somewhere dangerous, don't forget to bring me along. I'm quite good in a pinch, I think.///[shocked]If something were to happen to you, I'd never forgive myself. At least give me the chance to protect you. That's all I want.","[blushing]I'll admit, when I used to think about the future, I used to be pretty pessimistic.///[angry]All I could see were disrespectful kittens growing into disrespectful adults and ruining everything. Total societal decline. Complete moral failure.///[thinking]Somehow, I've changed my mind. Maybe the future can be bright and happy and wholesome?///[happy]I don't know. There's a lot of work that needs doing for that to happen. I'm glad cats like you are fighting for it.","[blushing]I've loved many things in my life. First my parents, second my colony and its people. And now you, #player_name#.///[shocked]But this third time feels very different. I am still dealing with the emotions of it all... my head is swimming!","[thinking]I used to know a cat named [red]Delta[/red]. They were the shopkeeper at my old hometown.///[angry][red]Delta[/red] was an excellent merchant, but a terrible prankster! They were always trying to humiliate me for a quick laugh.///[neutral]If you ever try to pull a fast one on me, be warned! I've got a sharp eye for tomfoolery and I won't tolerate it or appreciate it.","[neutral]I had serious reservations about bringing together so many cats from so many different backgrounds. How could this ever work out so well?///[thinking]You opened the floodgates and let anybody in when you started this #colony_title#. It's a bold tactic.///[neutral]I was convinced that our innate differences would tear the group apart sooner or later. I'm glad to see that I was wrong.///[happy]You're a smart cat, #player_name#. You accomplished what I thought was impossible. That's amazing, kid!","[blushing]Sometimes when I'm at my post, my thoughts start wandering. I always end up thinking about you.///[shocked]Is that normal? Should I go talk to the doctor about it? That never used to happen before.","[neutral]Where are you coming from? See anything interesting out that way? I haven't seen any action all day, and I'm starting to get bored.///[happy]I could use some excitement to keep me awake!","[angry]Hey, I'd rather not, ok? I've got a lot on my mind.","[happy]Wow, I never thought I'd see the day when I was a married cat.///[shocked]The reality of it all is rushing over me! I feel such a sense of responsibility now! There's so much I've got to do to protect you!",[blushing]It's nice to have someone else to care for. Life gets sort of stale after a while when you're only looking after yourself.///[happy]My new mission is to make you as happy as I can.,"[playful]I feel a little out of my league, being married to #leader_title_with_article# of #colony_title_with_article#. That's a really impressive title, you know.///[happy]It gives me such confidence in myself to know that you chose me. That must mean I'm pretty special, huh?","[blushing]One of these days I'm going to wake up early enough to go catch us both something for breakfast. It'll have to be before everybody else wakes up, of course.///[shocked]I'd never forsake my duties just to get a quick bite. You know that, right?///[neutral]Maybe tomorrow I'll plan on it. We'll see if I'm awake enough.","[shocked]Wow, planning that wedding was a lot of work, huh? Sending out the invites and decorating the venue and all. Takes a toll.///[blushing]It was all worth it. I would definitely do it all over again.","[happy]I keep catching myself smiling for no reason. I'll just be standing, staring at a tree, and this goofy grin will creep up on me.///[blushing]I'm guessing you have something to do with that, #player_name#. What do you think?","[blushing]Hey, if there's not too much on your plate, maybe we could spend some time together at home tonight?///[thinking]Last night was so chilly. I was glad to have you by my side for warmth.","[happy]Who would have thought that we would end up together, huh? I wouldn't have taken that bet.///[blushing]It's amazing that it happened at all! I still feel like I'm living inside a dream or something. You ever get that feeling?","[neutral]Your mind is incredible. I know that you put your #colony_title# first in everything you do. It's not an act with you, it's really what you want.///[blushing]I think that's what attracted me to you in the first place. Most cats have a hidden agenda, but with you, everything's straight forward and honest.///[happy]I try to act that way myself. We're perfect for each other, eh kid?","[happy]There's a fire that burns deep within you. I can see your spirit alight with a vision for the future.///[shocked]It's a very admirable trait! I wish every cat had as clear an idea of what they wanted as you.///[blushing]Of course, in your case, you're able to pair your vision with your incredible ability to get things done. You are a very capable cat.///[neutral]Keep up the good work, #player_name#. I'm very proud of you, you know.","[thinking]My parents died when I was very young, so I never really got to know them.///[neutral]But in my scattered memories I recall them being very loving towards one another. They seemed to have everything together. They were the envy of the colony.///[blushing]I always wondered if that was something I'd ever get to experience firsthand, and then you came into my life.","[neutral]When I get stressed out, I like to stare at the water. It's calming, and it reminds me of my old hometown.///[thinking]We had a roaring waterfall that fed a gentle river that ran through the center of town. To get from one side to the other, you'd have to hop across some big stones.///[neutral]Do you have something you do when you need to calm your mind, #player_name#?","[blushing]Never thought I'd be getting all sentimental since that's not really my style, but I just spent the last hour thinking about how we met.///[happy]Things have been on the up and up since that day. You've really enriched my life. Days are brighter when you have someone that loves you by your side.","[playful]Hey, kid. You're pretty special. You know that, right?///[happy]I couldn't be more proud of you. Heck, I'd admire you even if we weren't married. A cat like you is one in a million.","[happy]Keep your chin up! Your bright spirit is contagious. It makes me want to be a better version of myself.///[neutral]And if you ever have anything you need to talk about, you know I'm here for you, right? I'll stay by your side no matter what.","[shocked]Had to fight off a [green]Bat[/green] that flew a little too close to town earlier. In the middle of broad daylight, too! The nerve of some creatures.///[happy]Hey, if I see him again, I'll call for you, ok? I know you could convince him to never return.","[happy]Everything feels different when you're a married cat. I used to live day to day and never thought much about the future, but now it's all I can think about.///[playful]My head is swimming with so many ideas for things I want to accomplish! I know that we can work together to enrich our lives. Neat, huh?","[playful]You're a very social cat, aren't you #player_name#? You're always going around town making sure everyone is ok.///[neutral]That's neat and all, but it's not who I am. I'm happy to have you in my life as both my spouse and a close friend, but I don't need much more than that.///[blushing]I love you, #player_name#.","[neutral]I like how you've decorated our den, #player_name#. It's comfortable. More importantly, it's you. I can see your personality come through.///[happy]It brightens my day to see it because it reminds me of you.","[blushing]Feels like we were so young when we got married, huh #player_name#? Like it was forever ago. I feel like a different cat now.///[happy]It's so cool how in a marriage the two of you get to grow and change together. I get to fall back in love with you over and over again.","[neutral]Hey #player_name#, just wanted to let you know that #npc_name_kittenfour# came up to me yesterday and asked if they could join for guard duty.///[shocked]I didn't know what to say so I said 'sure, why not.' They came and sat by my side all day. Didn't speak a word.///[neutral]Honestly that's the best I could have asked for. They got to see what my job is like, and I didn't have to talk to anybody. It's a win-win.","[angry]Hey kid. Mind telling those younger cats to straighten up? I don't like how noisy they are when they're fooling around.///[thinking][hiss]Horseplay like that's got no place in a civilized society. Some cat could get hurt. Besides, it's distracting me from my job.","[thinking]Everything looks quiet out there to the west. That's how I like it.///[neutral]I stand guard here every day and I never see anything out of the ordinary, of course. But who knows what would happen if no one were here to keep watch?///[thinking]It would be pure anarchy. Mark my words. Anarchy!",[neutral]Hello #leader_title#. Nothing to report to the east. Should be safe to venture out a short distance if you'd like. I can watch over town if you have errands to attend to.,"[thinking]Some cats are trying to get smart with me. Take that #npc_name_zephyr# kid for instance. Keeps trying to chat me up and brings me gifts on their way out of town.///[shocked]I don't mind a present, but I think that slick-talker is trying to bribe me. Sooner or later they're going to expect me to look the other way, and I won't do it.","[neutral]I heard #npc_name_talon# whispering to themself quietly. They were very upset. All I caught was 'ought to rip into that no-good...'///[shocked]Suspicious words, don't you think? I'll keep a close eye on them for the rest of the day just in case. Nothing will happen on my watch.",,,,,,[shocked]We're all counting on you.,,,,,,,,,,"[angry]Will you quit your bellyaching and lend a paw already? The job won't ever get done with that attitude.///[thinking]We'll settle down once we find the right spot.

That doesn't sound good...///[angry]What if they're still out there, lurking in the forest just beyond the camp? What if we aren't safe?","[neutral]Then it sounds like we are agreed. Next, we should have #player_name# decide exactly which part of [orange]the Wildwood[/orange] we should settle in.///[thinking]I have the latest scout reports right here. These are the spots that would make for a suitable home. Which one will it be?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[neutral]Hey kid.

Won't lift a paw to help until they get their [green]Valerian[/green]. It's hard to watch.///[thinking]But #npc_name_spark# is strong, and I have to admit that the work will go quicker with their help. Can you hurry up and share that [green]Valerian[/green] with them already?",[neutral]Great work with #npc_name_spark#. Shelter will be complete in no time between the three of us.///[thinking]I wonder what #npc_name_coco# was so upset about?

Or you will lose track and be just like #npc_name_krampy#.","[playful]I am taking the entire day to test my new theory! It's a gift to myself. You are helping with the field research portion, because it involves you, of course.///[thinking]Now if you could stand as still as possible for the next five minutes... Yes, hrrmmm. It's just as I had suspected.///[happy]How exciting!","[shocked]I am not here to party! I find this is the best time to collect fresh blooms to stuff into my mask. Yes, the pollen is troublesome, but the protection they offer from disease is unrivalled!///[thinking]One word of caution, avoid the [green]Daisies[/green]. They may look pretty, but they are toxic!","[happy]If you wish to play in the games, I will stand on the sidelines and cheer you on. I believe a healthy level of support can make a cat perform better, but how will I know for sure unless I can test my theory?","[shocked]What a glorious aroma!///[blushing]I had thought it was the flowers, being especially beautiful this year, but then I realized it was you.","[neutral]These festivals are the perfect time for cats to run around and get some exercise! It is a very healthy thing to do, #player_name#. Take it from me, I'm a doctor!","[playful]It is a glorious day to spend with someone I care about.///[blushing]That would be you, #player_name#. In case I was not obvious enough!","[blushing]I could lounge about in the sun all day with you, #player_name#.///[happy]But that would be irresponsible! I have duties to attend to. I must watch the games to ensure no cats sprain an ankle or take a hard fall.///[thinking]I am never off the clock, but I think that lends a great sense of purpose to my life.","[happy]I don't need any [red]Festival Tokens[/red]! I'm here to scare cats with my mask. It is a reward in and of itself!///[playful]Care to join me, #player_name#? We would make an excellent team!","[happy]This is my favorite festival! What a lovely celebration!///[thinking]One year, I painted myself like a pumpkin and curled up in a ball. Then, when young kittens would stroll by, I would jump up and mew really loud.///[happy]Such fond memories!","[playful]Help me find the best hiding spot, #player_name#! I've got a new routine for jumping out and scaring cats. I've been waiting for this day all year!///[thinking]Perhaps, now that we're married, I'll let you in on my secrets for a perfect scare...///[happy]Or perhaps not!",[happy]My mask keeps my nose snug and warm! What a practical piece of clothing. I believe every cat should own one.,"[blushing]My my, what a romantic festival! The lights are so pretty in their festive colors. Isn't this cozy, #player_name#?","[blushing]We have come a long ways together, #player_name#. I'm glad to have you by my side.///[thinking]Some days at the clinic are rough, so it's nice to always be able to return home to such a loving and caring cat. I'm very grateful for you, #player_name#.","[neutral]There are so many birds in the trees, singing to each other!///[thinking]What secrets are they hiding in their bird-language..? I must know!///[neutral]Tell me, #player_name#. Do you speak bird? No? What a shame.","[thinking]The flowers are in full bloom, which is a sight to behold. When I get the chance to step away from the clinic I may go to collect some.///[neutral]The humble [green]Marigold[/green] is of great use to me for its curative properties. If you ever have one to spare, bring it my way!",[neutral]Do be careful as you go about your day. I've had more than one cat report to the clinic with heat exhaustion.,"[shocked]It is quite sweaty in this mask! But I cannot abandon it, not even for a moment. It would expose my delicate face to the dangers of the outside world. Who knows what noxious maladies may afflict me then?","[thinking]Did you observe the autumnal equinox? I try my best to not miss it every year! It marks when the days and nights are exactly the same length.///[neutral]Timing it is a bit tricky, but I've devised a method using rocks and claw marks in the dirt. Perhaps one day I will teach it to you when I don't have so many patients to attend to.","[playful]Oh, you have a leaf stuck in your fur! I am licensed to assist with this matter. Allow me to separate it from your coat.///[happy]There we are! All better!","[shocked]Watch your paws! Frostbite is no laughing matter, and you don't want to deal with it. Try to not spend too much time swimming when it's this chilly out.","[neutral]We should be thankful that the long winter will soon be over. By my calculations, we are past the halfway point. #colony_title_capitalized_with_article_capitalized# could use a break from all this cold weather to get back on its paws.","This is #npc_name_krampy#'s den. A sign posted near the entryway reads 'Sterile zone! Experiments in progress! Do not enter without a summons!'///In the gloom, you can spot some glass jars filled with strangely colored liquids. Something vile is squirming around inside one of the vessels!","[shocked]I must advise you to ignore the experiment in the back of the den! Mere observation will alter its result considerably. Pay no heed to it!///[blushing]Safest to stay in the front, near the clinic. I can't even remember what I've left laying about! Probably something dangerous, knowing me.","[happy]While I am accustomed to seeing many cats in the clinic, I don't often have visitors in my living quarters.///[thinking]Perhaps you can help me track down a leech that I lost yesterday? He slithered out of his jar on the shelf and plopped right on the floor. Surely he is still lurking about my bedroom somewhere...","[neutral]The clinic must remain a sterile environment at all times, so I keep my scientific experiments to the back part of the building. It may not look pretty, but it is very important work, I assure you!","[thinking]Perhaps you were expecting to see a whole wardrobe full of masks in my room? Nope, I only have the one! It has served me well for many years.","[happy]I would be delighted to welcome you into my personal quarters, #player_name#. It is a great honor to sit in one's home with #leader_title_with_article# of #colony_full_name_capitalized_with_article# and chat for a spell.","[happy]When I'm off the clock, I try to keep my schedule open so I'll have plenty of time to spend with you, #player_name#. I am glad you came by!///[thinking]There are plenty of fun things to do around the den for us both, I believe. I could use some help counting my leeches!","[blushing]Such a lovely cat as you does not belong in this humble place!///[happy]You stand out. In a good way, I assure you.","[happy]This is where I live, but I am not so attached to it that I would never move.///[blushing]...Oh, I have said too much. Do not read into my words, #player_name#! I will stop talking now.","[shocked]I meant to scrub the odorous purple stain from the back wall before you arrived, but then I became rather busy bird-watching. My apologies, #player_name#.///[thinking]I have heard that cats who are dating will do their best to tidy up their space to impress the other. I think I have failed in this task.///[neutral]If I come to visit you soon, I don't want you to feel all that pressure. #npc_name_krampy# is simply content to spend time with you, dirty den or not.","[playful]Now that we are dating, perhaps I could ask your advice about redecorating? You have an impeccable eye for detail, #player_name#. It is one of the things I love best about you!///[thinking]I have heard that a well-furnished clinic can lead to shorter recovery times for the sick and injured patients that stay there. Do you suppose it's true?","[sad]I have been up since midnight. A cat came to me in the middle of the night with a serious injury that needed urgent care, which I was happy to provide.///[shocked]But now I'm quite tired! If the clinic is not too busy today, I might take a nap. Wake me if something important comes up.",[shocked]I believe I forgot to go to bed last night. I was so enraptured with a project that I lost track of time. At least the passion keeps me wide awake!,"[happy]It's nice to see our #leader_title# working so diligently this early in the day. With a hard worker like you at the helm, we cannot be anything but successful!","[thinking]Long hours are an unavoidable aspect of my job. As a doctor, you never know when a cat may need your help, so I try to keep the clinic open whenever possible. Late nights are fairly common for me.","[neutral]You are still running about at this late hour? I commend you for that, #player_name#. It's nice to have someone to chat with. Helps me stay awake 'til my shift is over.",[playful]I don't mind being up this late. Things usually settle down and I have some time alone with my thoughts to ponder on the mysteries of life.///[thinking]Some of my greatest scientific breakthroughs happen in the twilight hours when everyone else is asleep!,[neutral]My mask provides me with adequate protection for my eyes from the harsh rays of the sun. Just another reason I wear it every day!,"[happy]Ah, this fog is perfect weather for sneaking around! Perhaps I'll find a good opportunity to scare someone. I await the opportunity with great excitement!///[playful]Do you know of any cats that would be easy to scare, #player_name#?","[thinking]The rain is a natural part of the cycles of the world. The air must be purified by the drops of water. Then, for a fleeting moment, all is calm and healthy.///[neutral]It's like the earth is taking a massive bath to cleanse itself of any impurities. Isn't that a beautiful thought?",[angry]I don't like snow. It's cold and wet and it gets everywhere. The difference in temperature between the outside air and the air next to my face makes my mask fog up! How dreadful and unpleasant.,"[happy]By my beak, what a beautiful day to be out and about! Days like these don't come around often enough. Isn't this storm thrilling? My hair is standing on end with pure excitement!///Make the most of it, #player_name#! Never know when we'll have a lightning show like this again.","[shocked]Is it not painful to walk about in this terrible weather? Does the snow not pelt your face like an unending avalanche of ice??///[thinking]It is my professional opinion that every cat should spend this day curled up in bed, waiting for it to end!","[shocked]Oh my! You are sick and wounded! #player_name#, I may be able to assist you if you'll accept my help!","[thinking]Hrmmm, I am not a dietician but I would still recommend that you watch your diet. You appear to be quite hungry at the moment.///[neutral]A balanced and healthy meal would do you a lot of good right now.","[sad]Sadly, my oaths require me to provide you with medical care if need be. Otherwise, I would prefer to pass on ever interacting with you again!","[shocked]Say, did you happen to hear a bit of a loud boom last night?///[happy]No? ...Good. No reason.",[playful]What an exquisite day for some field research! I intend to wrap up my findings on whether or not [green]Rock Debris[/green] may be transmuted into [green]Gold[/green] today.///[happy]Spoiler alert!! ...[sad]it cannot. Ah well. Some day my time in the limelight will come and I will be recognized by the scientific community at long last!,"[neutral]My colleagues assure me that it is impossible to cure the common cold with a treatment of leeches.///[shocked]But that is precisely why I must persist in the application of my methods! If nobody else is testing these hypotheses, how then can we be certain?","[thinking]It is becoming ever so difficult to find willing test subjects in this #colony_title#. Ever since the incident with the [green]Snake[/green], it's as if nobody trusts me.///[angry]Science is a baffling mistress with a will that cannot be understood! I am nothing more than its mouthpiece.","[shocked]Is my fur a bit greener than usual? Please do tell me the truth. I have spent all morning rolling around in fresh grass clippings for precisely this purpose.///[thinking]My findings so far: Green coloration, yes. Annoying pollen in nose, yes. Invisibility, sadly no. Not yet.","[thinking]I have sworn an oath to my patients to protect their health with everything in my power. If that involves experimental treatments, then so be it!///[neutral]I have far too few colleagues in my field. We cats are still just beginning to figure out the mysteries of the body and its remedies. Perhaps some day we will be able to treat anything!///[thinking]Quite possibly with [green]Catnip[/green]. I'll get back to you on that one. You'd be surprised, but quality [green]Catnip[/green] is surprisingly hard to come by.","[happy]As your doctor, I would advise you strongly to stay out of the lake today. There are plans set into motion that cannot be stopped!///[shocked]But I cannot tell you what they are! Any interference with the experiment would be a catastrophic failure.///[happy]Let's just say that the [purple]swimming, scaly menaces of the deep[/purple] will be vanquished once and for all by noon tomorrow.","[neutral]Perhaps one day we will unlock all the secrets of the natural world. I think the pace of discovery would be greatly accelerated if every cat were as truth-seeking as I.///[sad]Sadly, I am getting old. Well, to be completely honest, I've been old for many years now. I must find a worthy heir to pass along my vast knowledge to before I disappear forever.///[thinking]Alternatively, I may discover the key to living forever. I've got a few ideas in the works on that front. If that happens, then you can safely ignore everything I've just said.///[happy]Yes, surely I will!","[shocked]It is my professional opinion that the constant fighting that our #colony_title# cats endure is not good for their health. However, I understand that it is a necessary evil.///[neutral]That is why I must always be ready to provide the highest-quality care available to any cat that needs it. The borders must be secured!","[playful]Some days I can hardly step away from the clinic. There are so many sick and injured cats to treat, so little time!///[shocked]I would take on an intern or assistant, but I cannot. I would not trust them to be as good at practicing medicine as #npc_name_krampy#! Quality healthcare must be provided to all.","[shocked]Oh my #player_name#, you are very sick! Very sick indeed! You have come to the right place, for I am also sick!///[playful]'Sick' as in 'cool', of course. I heard a kitten use that word for that meaning once.///[happy]It was simultaneously confusing and exciting to use the lingo of the youth! I must try it more often. Catch you later, sick one!","[thinking][red]Ducky[/red], is that you? Oh, no. It is just #player_name#. What a pity.///[neutral]You reminded me of an old friend of mine. Something about your stature and bearing. But [red]Ducky[/red] has not been around in ages. I must be losing my mind.","[happy]You know, I began wearing this mask of mine when I was very young and haven't set it aside since. It started as a way to conceal how many whiskers I was missing from my parents after a particularly explosive experiment went just right.///[playful]Now I don't have to worry about silly things like how many whiskers I have left! And mind you, the number shrinks by the week. I cannot slow down my research! Not for my face, not for anybody's face!","[neutral]I would like to think that my beak makes me more attuned to the graceful ways of the bird-folk. They are so beautiful as they drift across the sky, like tiny balls of yarn passing in front of the sun.///[playful]Oh, to be a bird, and spend the day carelessly floating about! Doesn't that sound delightful?///[shocked]Well, up until the time at which you are ferociously smacked down and devoured by a hungry kitten. That part does seem decidedly less appealing.","[shocked]Not all herbs are restorative, but all herbs have useful properties!///[thinking]Take [green]Snake Lily[/green], for example. I have heard tales of a fierce warrior applying the ichor of its crushed petals to her claws to increase her prowess in battle. How many cats untold have fallen victim to its deadly power?","[neutral]Are you visiting with every cat to ensure we are staying productive on this most auspicious day? That's a grand idea, #player_name#. I assure you, the clinic has never been busier!///[thinking]Although I am low on herbs, so I must take a break to track some down. Preferably [green]Marigold[/green] or [green]Goldenseal[/green], but it is ever so easy to get distracted when one encounters a clump of wild [green]Catnip[/green]...","[happy]It warms my cold, mask-laden heart to have a cat living so near who treasures the sciences as I do. Indeed, you have been a subject in many of my recent experiments. Perhaps you did not know, but that was precisely the point.///[playful]I am always recording, always observing, always hypothesizing something new! Though my paws may slow with my old age, my mind never shall!","[playful]Theoretically, if I were to find another gray striped cat with somewhat lengthy fur and an advanced age, strap a beaky mask to their face, make them work the clinic for the day... do you suppose anybody would notice my trickery?///[happy]Has it happened before? I must decline to answer! Will it happen again? My answer is the same! Am I even #npc_name_krampy# right now, talking to you??///[playful]I like to keep you on your toes, #player_name#!","[shocked]My my, I am ever so hungry!///[playful]Hungry for [b]science[/b]! My appetite cannot be satiated!///[thinking]But also, hungry for a #item_name_turtle#. I could do with a snack break.","[angry]The youth of today have no manners! Always talking to ticks, or ticking to talks. Something along those lines, I'm not entirely sure if I've got the phrase quite right.///One of them stole my scalpel! Mark my words, I will find out who did it and haunt them until they confess their crimes!///[happy]Oh, what fun! I'm quite excited at the prospect. Now then, any leads on who may have done it? I have a jar of [green]Spiders[/green] I've been meaning to find a use for.",[shocked]My postulations have all gone awry! My suppositions are askew!///[sad]What does it mean? Am I finally losing it for good??,"[blushing]I never imagined I, #npc_name_krampy#, would get involved in romance at my age. It simply is not done! All the signs pointed to me carrying out my duties alone until one day I ceased to be.///[happy]How spectacular it is to be wrong for once! There is no compelling precedence for these results. Perhaps this experiment goes beyond the ways of science? How preposterous!","[neutral]In my years as a doctor, I have of course participated in several autopsies. I have seen the inner mechanisms of cats' hearts, and also their brains.///[thinking]What was suspiciously lacking from these procedures was the feelings of these deceased cats. Where are they stored? Surely not in either of the aforementioned places.///[neutral]Perhaps it is true that every cat has a soul that transcends their physical body. This requires further study.","[playful]You must understand, if we are to continue our relationship, that I must split my time between you and [purple]Science[/purple]. [purple]She[/purple] constantly requires my time and devotion. Some things cannot be changed or negotiated!",[thinking]I'm getting better at guessing your actions. You arrived within a minute of my prediction today. Perhaps my careful study of your behaviors is paying off?,"[happy]I heard a rumor that you were dating now. How embarrassing! You have feelings!///[playful]Of course I know you're dating me. It does not lessen the amount of teasing I am entitled to give you. [bouncy]#player_name#'s got a special friend, #player_name#'s got a special friend, and their name is #npc_name_krampy#[/bouncy]! Haha!","[neutral]Do I look different today? Perhaps... undeniably alluring?///[playful]I am attempting to concoct a perfect perfume that will make any cat 1000% more attractive. So far, it seems it only makes cats faintly glow in the dark.///[shocked]Also, it smells vile and repugnant. I do apologize for what your nose must be experiencing at this very moment. I think I've developed an immunity to it from over-exposure.","[thinking]Have you happened to see a massive swarm of [green]Wolf Spiders[/green] crawl by, perhaps around five minutes ago? I seem to have misplaced mine.///[happy]Say, now that we're dating, maybe I can talk you into chasing them down for me? They are ever so grouchy and difficult to stick in a jar. I think they are displeased with me, and I guarantee you they would recognize my mask in an instant.","[playful]I have plenty of time for talking! I am waiting for some chemicals to combine and settle, which should take several hours. At the end of the day I will either have another successful experiment in the bag or a crater where my den used to stand.///[neutral]No way to know for sure, hence the experiment.///[thinking]Perhaps I might recommend that we head out on a walk for a little while? I'd hate to be standing nearby when my test comes to fruition.","[happy]Even the most productive of scientists must take a break from their work some times. Some of my best ideas have come to me when I was focused on something else entirely.///[thinking]Do you find that to be true in your life, #player_name#? When dealing with a particularly tricky problem, the subconscious brain is always picking away at potential solutions, even when we aren't aware. The answer can surface at the strangest of times.","[blushing]By my beak, you are rather dashing today! Did you get all cleaned up just for me? That makes me feel like the luckiest cat in the world.","[happy]We certainly are getting to know each other pretty well, wouldn't you say so #player_name#? Of course, I have many stories I have not had the time to share just yet. They will come up when they are relevant!///[thinking]Mostly stories about me and my old pal [red]Ducky[/red]. Mostly the two of us doing wildly dangerous and irresponsible things.///[shocked]That may be why I haven't been so forthcoming about those tales.","[neutral]I try to get away from the clinic for a little while each day. A change of scenery and some fresh air is a uniquely helpful catalyst when confronting a mental block. Also, as a doctor, I recommend you get outside and spend some time exercising whenever possible.///[shocked]Sorry, I am talking to you as if you were a patient, and not my date. Old habits die hard, #player_name#.","[blushing]I have always been inspired by your heroic manner, #player_name#. It's why I moved here in the first place. I knew that with you as #leader_title_with_article#, any #colony_title# would be wildly successful.///[happy]It feels extra special that we ended up dating like this. I think it's important that any two romantic partners be mutual fans of each others' work.","[thinking]I am rather excited to be associated with you, #player_name#. And more than just associated, but in a dating relationship! It's almost more than #npc_name_krampy#'s heart can handle.///[shocked]I must find a remedy for these strong feelings before they begin to interfere with my work!","[playful]It is a glorious day to be here with you, #player_name#. My research can wait! It is more pressing that I spend some quality time with my #player_name#.","[blushing]I fear I have come down with an incurable condition. It is affection for you, #player_name#. The only known treatment is to spend more time with you, I'm afraid.","[thinking]A single moment, a stroke of sudden brilliant insight, can alter the entire future of a scientist. So it was with me!///[blushing]On one clear night, as I stared up at the moon, I realized that I was falling for you, #player_name#. Since that moment, my life has not been the same as it was before. It can and does happen to everyone, so why was I so caught off guard by it?///[neutral]These are the moments that define a life. Fleeting though they may be, we must recognize them for what they are.",[blushing]Is this what love is like? Such an odd sensation. My paws are warm and my nose keeps twitching whenever you are near.///[thinking]Perhaps I can observe these phenomena more closely and begin to develop a body of research to inform others. That way they will not be as unprepared as I was!,"[blushing]How strange. I was just daydreaming about you showing up, and here you are. Perhaps that is just another sign of my infatuation? I must make a note of it.","[happy]If I could spend the rest of my days with you, I would consider my life to be a success. Of course, I have many other goals and aspirations that I do not intend to abandon, but you have somehow taken precedence over them all.","[angry]I cannot place my paw on it, but something is amiss! You must feel it too, #player_name#. Perhaps it is time to begin wrapping up this little experiment, once and for all.","[shocked]Goodness! We are married, #player_name#! What a preposterous proposition! What an incredulous idea! What a happy happenstance!///[happy]Somehow the multitude of variables combined to create this amazing result.","[happy]When I go to work at the clinic, I remind myself that I'm working hard for you, #player_name#. It gives me an incredible sense of purpose and responsibility.///[shocked]Goodness, did I just say responsibility?///[playful]#npc_name_krampy# has not been called 'responsible' in a very long time.","[playful]I have devised an improved method for tracking time! Last night, I slept for exactly seven hours, thirty-two minutes, and twelve seconds.///[happy]Why are those numbers important? Who knows! But at least now I have them.","[shocked]If you stumble across a pulsating mass of glowing leaves near the entrance of our den, I would advise steering clear. Fear not, for #npc_name_krampy# has it under control!///[thinking]It was not the intended result of my experiment, obviously, but I have kept it around because it is ever so entertaining to poke and prod.","[blushing]This mask has many practical applications! For example, you cannot even tell that I am blushing right now because I am thinking about how good you look today.///[shocked]Ack! I have revealed my secret! Such a glaring oversight on my part! Pretend that you heard nothing, #player_name#.","[neutral]I am working on a new poultice that should be able to heal even the deepest of cuts with great speed. I had considered asking you to help me test it out, but I cannot bring myself to subject you to such research any longer.///[shocked]What if something were to happen to you?! #npc_name_krampy# could never live with the guilt!///[thinking]Mind you, I have full faith and confidence in my methods. I am simply planning for the worst-case scenario.",[playful]How pleasant it is to have a den to return to in the evenings. I had lived in my clinic and laboratory for several years. I forgot what it was like to have a home life separate from work.,[thinking]Do I still have any charring in my fur? I attempted to run down to the lake to wash my face before you could see so that you would not worry about me.///[happy]I am ever so considerate!,"[happy]I would pack you a lunch, but I have quite a busy day ahead of me. Many patients to treat and many remedies to prepare. I am grateful that you are so understanding about my work, #player_name#.","[thinking]We all have many roles to fulfill. I am the [purple]doctor[/purple]. You are #leader_title_with_article#.///[neutral]I am a not-bird, and you are a not-dog. Regardless of what we may wish, this is the unfortunate truth.///[happy]But our occupations and hobbies alone do not paint the full picture. I am also [purple]your spouse[/purple], and you are also [purple]my spouse[/purple]! How wonderful it is to have so many roles.","[thinking]Perhaps some day I will collect additional masks to add to my collection. But I am so attached to this one, so it is difficult for me to consider the idea too seriously.///[playful]You are quite fashionable, #player_name#. Hence why I was attracted to you in the first place. Perhaps you have an opinion on the matter?","[happy]I had thought for years that love had passed me by, and that I must devote myself to my work because I had no other options. Then you came along, #player_name#, and now I know that I can have both a world-changing career and a life-changing romance.","[playful]I do try to keep my lectures to a minimum for your sake. I know that my work can be rather dry and boring to many cats, perhaps even you, #player_name#.///[thinking]I am not good at distilling my thoughts into written word, so I must share my findings verbally. Sometimes with you, sometimes with others, but either way, my research must live on when I am gone.","[blushing]There is nothing that can keep me from discovering the secrets of the universe! With you by my side, I feel unstoppable.","[happy]Did you know? Snuggling up with a loved one can reduce your stress level, release bonding chemicals, and make one generally happier? That is why, as a doctor, I can wholeheartedly recommend it to you!///[blushing]Now then, if you need a cuddling partner, I may know a cat who would be interested in the role...",[thinking]Perhaps you have some free time today to go for a walk with me? I could use the fresh air. There are far too many bad miasmas floating around the clinic lately.///[happy]And I could also use some quality time with my beloved #player_name#.,"[happy]Anytime you offer me a flower, I stuff it directly into my mask when you aren't looking. I am always very appreciative for them, #player_name#! You know that I am a practical cat, so you offer practical gifts.///[blushing]How fortunate I am to call you mine.","[playful]You should know that I am very proud of you, #player_name#. Not only do you love me dearly, but you are also a very accomplished #leader_title#. You have done great things for this #colony_title#.///[thinking]Too many cats withhold praise from their much-deserving loved ones. I do not wish that to be the case for me. I want you to always feel how proud of you I truly am, #player_name#.","[shocked]If you heard me snoring in the night, I apologize! My mask has a way of amplifying its volume, and you and I both know it would be perilous to remove it for any reason.///[thinking]If it happens again, please do wake me and tell me to knock it off. I see no other solution.","[blushing]If you get hurt out there, remember to stop by the clinic and see me for treatment. Or just stop by to chat. Or just to hang out. #npc_name_krampy# is not picky on the reason you stop by.///[happy]I just love seeing you, #player_name#!","[happy]Goodness me! You have kittens now, #player_name#! How things have changed!///[playful]From my analysis, your kittens appear to be the healthiest little ones I've seen in a very long time. Keep them in good health and they will no doubt grow up strong!","[shocked]Goodness! What a remarkable mask, #player_name#! It's the mirror image of mine! Where ever did you discover such a curious article?///[happy]I am honored to have inspired our #leader_title# with my sense of fashion. Mimicry is the highest form of flattery, as they say.","[thinking]I don't mind it when #npc_name_spark# comes to visit, I really don't.

I saw #npc_name_coco# dragging lots of accessories to the prize booth earlier if you want something new.",[happy]Nothing beats a cool autumn day with you! It's going to get chilly soon. More time for curling up in the den and snuggling!,"[shocked]I can see my own breath! Woah, it's like I'm a fire-breathing dragon!

I like to crush the petals to make colorful dyes for my projects.,"[shocked]Woah, when did the grass all die? It looks so sad and brown!",[thinking]There's fewer and fewer [green]fireflies[/green] out at night. Have you noticed?///[neutral]It's a shame! I really like watching them bounce around.,[shocked]It got cold fast this year! Better settle in for a chilly winter. I've already made a thick pile of leaves in the corner of the den so that I can bundle up and stay warm at night.,[thinking]Heading out into the wilderness around this time of year is a really unique experience. There's hardly any noise to begin with because most animals are tucked away in their burrows.///[shocked]And the snow absorbs the rest of the sound! It's quiet and peaceful.,,"[playful]Oh, if I had known you were coming I would have picked up my art supplies! #npc_name_fliss# always tells me I can be a bit forgetful about my space.","[thinking]Do you wanna see my latest project?

It's not finished!///[happy]Better to wait until it's ready.",[neutral]#npc_name_fliss#'s side of the den has always been a bit messier than mine. I like to keep my space spick and span!

It can be like a fun little game!","[thinking]I've been thinking about ripping a hole in the wall in the back of the den and starting to build an expansion with some twigs and leaves I found, but I don't think #npc_name_fliss# would appreciate it.///[happy]I said it could be my art studio! But I don't think I was very convincing. I've never really worked in construction before, so I get where the concern comes from. Maybe I'll meet a nice Mole to do the job for me.","[blushing]Wait wait wait, you can't see my latest art project! It's supposed to be a surprise! Don't go digging in my things, ok #player_name#?","[shocked]Maybe we can spend time together somewhere else, #player_name#? I'm a little embarrassed by the state of the den. Plus, you never know when #npc_name_fliss# is going to come and breathe down your neck here.",[thinking]I really need to get my own space. It's no fun having to share a den when you're just trying to hang out with your date...,"[happy]Hey, do you wanna help me organize my art supplies? They're kinda everywhere at the moment.///[shocked]Oh wait, that's probably rude to ask of your date. Never mind, pretend I didn't say anything!",[neutral]I'd honestly rather hang out at your place or out in the wilderness. My den is way too cramped and busy for it to be romantic.,"[sad]Woah, I can't stop yawning. Now you're yawning too! Sorry, it's contagious!","[happy]I'm an early to bed, early to rise kind of cat! The more daylight, the better!","[neutral]When you get up early, you have more time to be awake and play. Sleep is overrated anyway!","[thinking]Phew, it's about time I turned in for the night. My eyelids keep drooping. I've never been one to stay up late.","[angry]Sorry if I'm a little short with you, I get grumpy when I'm tired.",[shocked]It's so dark out! How can you even see anything? I keep stumbling on tree roots. I think I hit my paw pretty bad.,"[happy]It's the perfect day for some fishing! After you jump into the river to catch a [green]fish[/green], you can dry out your fur quicker because the sun is out.","[shocked]Woah, what's with all the fog? Did we do something bad? Is this some sort of mysterious sign from the #npc_name_theforestguardian#?","[playful]Most cats get all grumpy when there's the tiniest bit of rain. I don't mind it at all!///[thinking]I've always liked swimming, and it kinda feels like that. Plus, as an added bonus, it gets your fur all clean!","[playful]I like to catch the snowflakes on my tongue and count them. I think I'm somewhere in the three-hundreds, but I lost track when you said hello.///[happy]Well, guess I gotta start again from zero!","[happy]Oh, this is incredible! It's like a free light show. I love it when the thunder rattles the ground, isn't it the coolest??","[shocked]I'm surprised you could see me in all this snow! My white fur naturally blends in with it. Plus, I rubbed some on my back as an experiment.///[neutral]I was trying to be sneaky and see if my camouflage worked! I guess it didn't.",[shocked]You look like you stuck your nose up a beehive! You feeling alright #player_name#?,"[neutral]Is it snack time already? I'd share my leftover [green]Blackberries[/green] with you, but I need them for an art project. Sorry #player_name#.",[angry]Why don't you go bother somebody else for once?,[happy]Maybe someday I'll show you the secret hideout that #npc_name_fliss# helped me build in the forest.///[blushing]Oh wait! I wasn't supposed to tell anybody about that!! Sorry #npc_name_fliss#...,"[playful][bouncy]I got paws, I got claws, when I walk by it will make you pause![/bouncy]///[shocked]Oh, sorry!! I was just singing to myself.","[neutral]I love #npc_name_fliss# so much, but I will admit, it's nice to go out on my own. They just aren't very imaginative. They leave all the imagining to me!","[thinking]Do you ever spend all day looking at the clouds? I convinced #npc_name_fliss# to watch the clouds with me once. They said they were studying them for meteorology, which doesn't even make sense because there weren't any meteors.///[neutral]Meteors only come at night anyways. But I enjoyed watching the clouds. I saw so many animals and plants in them.///[happy]My favorite was one that looked just like a [green]Trout[/green]!","[neutral]#npc_name_fliss# understands me like no other cat ever has. We've been through everything together.///[thinking]We have a lot of other siblings, but the two of us were always especially close, even from a very young age. That's why we moved out here together!","[neutral]Growing up, our mother always did what she could to provide for us. It's amazing how she scavenged for us and our five other siblings.///[shocked]Can you imagine having to hunt to feed so many children? She was a very strong cat! We both miss her a lot.",[happy]I like bold colors. I use them often when I'm making art.///[shocked]Maybe it's because I was born with such dull fur. What a boring hue!,"[playful]What do you do in your free time, #player_name#? Or do you not have any free time? Is being #leader_title_with_article# really busy? I'll bet it's really busy.///[shocked]Oh, I haven't given you a chance to answer any of my questions! Sorry. #npc_name_fliss# tells me I ramble sometimes. I'm working on it.","[neutral]When you've got six siblings, you find out pretty quick that you need to entertain yourself somehow. So I got really into art!///[thinking]If you start a project that you're passionate about, you can easily sink entire seasons into it. Heck, even years!","[happy]You must have had an interesting life, #player_name#. I don't think cats become #leader_title# by accident. Do you have any awesome stories to share about what things were like before starting this #colony_title#?///[playful]It's very inspiring! Maybe I'll write a song about your life someday.","[neutral]Oof, you might want to step back. I just ate a giant [green]Salmon[/green]. #npc_name_fliss# says it makes my breath smell bad. Is that true?","[happy]Think I might go for a swim in the lake later today.///[playful]You wanna come, #player_name#? Or are you one of those cats that can't stand getting a little wet?","[neutral]I heard there's lots of pretty [green]gems[/green] in a big cave somewhere. That sounds cool, but I don't want to go in there!///[shocked]I hear there's nasty bats that will rip you to shreds if you set foot inside! And how can you fight back if it's too dark to see?","[happy]I have a lot of fond memories from my childhood. Playing with my siblings, mostly.///[thinking]My mother was the kindest cat I've ever known. She didn't have the luxury of an entire #colony_title# to help support her. She had to do everything herself! Raising seven kittens must have been tough.","[happy]I woke up this morning with a serious hankering for adventure! I won't rest until I've had an exciting day. Do you ever feel extra energetic like that, or is it just me?",[shocked]You must live such an exciting life! Can I shadow you for the day? Pretty please??///[happy]I want to be just like you someday!,"[blushing]I would be happy if we could go adventuring together forever, #player_name#.","[happy]What was your childhood like? Did you have lots of siblings, or were you an only child? What was your favorite game to play?///[thinking]Oh, I'm doing it again, aren't I?",[playful]I'm super grateful to have an awesome sibling like #npc_name_fliss#. They've always supported me and made me feel special.///[happy]Everybody needs a good cheerleader like that in their life.,[happy]I feel like I could run a marathon today! Or maybe swim one. I haven't made up my mind either way. But I do know that I need to get moving soon or I'll be antsy!,[sad]I thought you liked me... I was so naive.,"[shocked]Is it weird to call you [orange]pumpkin[/orange]? I don't mean I want to like, eat you or carve you up or anything like that. I dunno, it just seemed like a cute nickname. Hrmm...","[blushing]Did you actually ask me out, or was that just a dream? 'Cause I'm about to be really, really embarrassed if that was just a dream.///[happy]Oh good, it was for real! That's so exciting!","[shocked]Don't be mad, but I think I already misplaced the [green]Red Rose[/green] you gave me!///[neutral]I had it next to my art supplies because I was going to paint a picture of it, and the next time I went to check it was gone. I'm sure it'll turn up!///[thinking]I just hope I can find it before it withers.","[happy]To tell you the truth, I've always had a crush on you, #player_name#. I can't believe we're actually dating!","[playful]Hey, if we were out in the forest and a giant gang of evil cats surrounded us, you'd protect me, right?///[thinking]I'd fight as best as I could, but I'm not the strongest of cats. I'd need all the help I could get!","[playful]Oh, I found the [green]Red Rose[/green] by the way. I had misplaced it a couple days ago, I think I told you? Maybe not. Anyways, it turned up.///[happy]I had brought it to bed with me one night and it got lost under some leaves.

It is beautiful.///[happy]Just like you.,"[happy][purr]I'm so happy to see you. I missed you a lot all morning.

It's a quirk of mine.///[thinking]#npc_name_fliss# finds it annoying, but I hope you don't because it brightens my day to be able to sing when my heart tells me to!","[shocked]Oh, was I humming again?///[happy]I can't help it.

I've got a lot of energy and need an outlet!///[thinking]Oh, you're probably busy with important #colony_title# business.

It's a great day now!","[sad]After all we've been through, it's hard to live with what we've become.

I like it!","[blushing]Oh #player_name#, you are so beautiful today!///[thinking]I hope you can always see yourself the way I see you. If you did, you would never ever feel bad about yourself.",[playful]I can't believe I have two of the most amazing cats in my family. I am the luckiest cat alive because you and #npc_name_fliss# will always have my back.,[happy]Want to go for a run? I've been trying to get back into the habit. After getting married I stopped jogging and now it's hard to start again.///[playful]Maybe if you came along it would be easier! What do you say?,"[blushing]I need you to get going.

But seriously, what do you want to talk about?","[sad]If you don't mind, I was actually hunting.///[neutral]I know you are trying to be nice talking to me, but I've kind of got everything handled here. You can keep making the rounds, I'm all good!","[thinking]You have a big job to do, being #leader_title_with_article#. I hope you can handle it.///[neutral]If I were #leader_title_with_article#, I would probably take on way too much work and get stressed out. Time-management isn't my strongest trait.///[shocked]Oh, sorry for the unsolicited advice. I don't know what I'm talking about. Anyways, I've got a lot to do. Good seeing you.","[neutral]I actually enjoy eating berries just as much as prey sometimes. They make for a nice treat every once in a while.///[shocked]Oh, except [green]Blackberries[/green]. Yuck. I don't see what any cat likes about them. Nasty, bitter little things.","[thinking]I don't think that hunting together is such a great idea. I don't understand why anyone would do that. Surely more cats would mean more noise to scare away the prey.///[thinking]We don't give [green]Squirrels[/green] enough credit, but their ears are powerful. They'll hear you coming from a mile away.","[neutral]I've been looking for more herbs lately.///[playful]Even the poisonous ones have their uses.///[shocked]Some cats feel bad about using [green]Snake Lily[/green], for example, but I don't get what the controversy is all about.///[neutral]When it comes to self-preservation, anything is fair game.",[thinking]So how have things been going with #colony_title_with_article#? Any dangers that we should all be made aware of?///[neutral]I'll let you know if I spot anything unusual on my daily outings.,[angry]I just can't stand [green]Crickets[/green]. I had one hiding in my den last month. It kept chirping at full blast every night while I was trying to get to sleep.///[shocked]I finally tracked it down and threw it in the river. Good riddance. I never want to see another [green]Cricket[/green] again.,"[thinking]There is more than just prey that we need to hunt...///[shocked]Did you hear that? Sorry, I was just talking to myself. It's a bad habit of mine. I'm working on it.",[neutral]There are plenty of herbs to go around. Don't worry about picking too many. I'm pretty sure that the other cats are hoarding them anyways.///[thinking]The Wildwood is quite generous if you know where to look. Every day new sprouts poke through the ground and new flowers begin to bloom. I don't think we'll ever run out.,"[neutral]You seem very determined. I like that about you, #player_name#. It's important to know what you are fighting for.///[neutral]Me? I'm fighting for my independence. I don't want to rely on anybody for anything if I can help it. Taking on too much risk has led to the downfall of some of the best.","[neutral]I prefer to hunt alone. It's nothing personal, it's just my preference. I can sneak well, and I worry that others would scare away the prey.///[thinking]I could probably go foraging with a partner, though. I'd imagine more eyes would help in that situation. Maybe someday I'll invite you along.","[thinking]Are you being safe, #player_name#? I'm not scared or anything, but it is a dangerous world out there. You need to keep your guard up.///[neutral]The sad truth of the world for cats is that we are not at the top of the ladder. We have to stay vigilant and strong in the face of the challenges that surround us.",[neutral]You've probably realized by now that I do whatever I can to fight against the voidling cats. I want to keep everyone safe.///[playful]I usually try to hide in a bush and ambush them as they walk by. I'm getting pretty good at it. I rarely have to fight for long.,"[neutral]Sometimes life gets hard, but we need to keep doing our best. There are a lot of things worth fighting for.///[neutral]Even a simple day of peace resting in a quiet den is worth the struggle.","[neutral]I must walk my path alone. I am glad that you are my friend, #player_name#, but there are some things that only I must do.///[thinking]I think everybody needs time for themselves, but I know I'm a bit of an outlier. I need a lot of time alone in order to feel happy.","[happy]I'm glad that we are friends, #player_name#. It is nice to forget about everything for a bit when you stop by.///[neutral]It's been very challenging for me to let you in to my inner circle, but I think it's been healthy. Friends have a way of rubbing off on one another. I'm trying to embrace it.","[happy]Glad to see that you are doing well, #player_name#. I worry sometimes about all of the cats in #colony_title_with_article#.///[angry]Everyone thinks they can take care of themselves, because they don't see the threat.///[neutral]I've started a ranking system of how capable every cat is to fend for themselves. You're somewhere near the top, of course.","[angry]I really put myself out there. I tried to get to know you, but it feels like I don't know you at all.///[angry]I'm going to go do some thinking. Alone.","[blushing]I never thought I would date anyone, #player_name#. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad we are dating, just surprised is all.///[neutral]We all spend some time envisioning the future, right? In mine, I was always alone. Strange how life works out differently.","[sad]Just because we are dating, that doesn't mean things have to change between us too much, right? You are a great friend to me, and I worry that I am going to screw it up.///[neutral]I mean, dating is all about relying on someone else. It's not exactly in my wheelhouse.///[thinking]I'm trying to keep an open mind.",[happy]I wouldn't mind talking for a while today. I'm in a social mood.///[neutral]Maybe we can head out on some adventure together and chat while we walk? I find a little exercise helps my brain wake up.,[neutral]This is so weird. I honestly forgot you gave me that [green]Red Rose[/green] until I saw you approaching. I'm still getting used to it.,"[neutral]If we're going to start our dating relationship off on the right foot, I think it's important to lay down some ground rules.///[thinking]I think it's important that we are friends first, and a couple second. If we don't like spending time together, I don't think we can be a healthy couple, you know?///[blushing]Lucky for you, I do like spending time with you. In small, measured increments, of course.","[angry]I never can get rid of them all! Something has to be done!///[shocked]Sorry, I didn't mean to go off. I'm just stressed out.///[sad]I just want to make sure that everyone is safe.","[happy]I'm glad that we are dating, #player_name#. It feels like I'm getting to know you more and more.///[blushing]I like you. Feels weird to say, but it's true. I've never had this experience before.///[neutral]I don't adjust easily when stuff like this happens. That's why I'm so grateful for your support.","[neutral]Another day means another chance to be a better cat than I was the day before. If you don't push yourself to improve, you probably won't be able to.///[thinking]Discipline is really the key to self-reliance. When everything depends on you, you have to be able to trust yourself to get the hard work done.","[playful]Hey #player_name#. I've been craving [green]Crow[/green] all day, but I haven't been able to track one down. Can't catch their scent for some reason.///[neutral]If you see one, let me know, ok?","[neutral]I know some cats think it's dumb that I'm stockpiling so much food. And, to be fair, I do have a lot of stuff in my storage.///[thinking]But I'm not paranoid. I'm a realist. What if a huge snowstorm shuts everybody in their dens for a month? What if there's a massive drought and all the prey leaves the area?///[neutral]You can't make your plans based on how things are today. You have to consider the worst-case scenario. Bad things do happen. How will you ride them out if you aren't prepared?","[blushing]I feel like we've got into a good rhythm, you and I. I know our relationship doesn't look like a traditional one, but that's ok with me.///[neutral]Every cat has to find what works for them, you know? Doesn't matter what others think or do.","[happy]Just because I want to be able to do everything for myself doesn't mean that I actually want to do everything by myself.///[playful]Heck, you've known me long enough to know that I'm a sucker for a good present! I appreciate that you can tell the difference.",[neutral]Today's another day of training. I'm working on my tracking skills.///[thinking]Too many cats get to the point that they're able to do the bare minimum required to survive. Then they stop growing.///[neutral]I think that's irresponsible. How will you ever know your true potential if you don't chase it down?,"[happy]It's no fun, but sometimes you have to look inward to identify what weaknesses you have so you can work on them. It's important to be as honest with yourself as you can.///[neutral]Nobody is unbiased when it comes to themselves. Hey, #player_name#, delicate question, but what weaknesses do you see in me?","[playful]Hey, something about how the sun caught in your fur there for a minute looked pretty cool. I lost my train of thought.///[blushing]Seems like that happens a lot when I see you approaching. Is that normal?","[blushing]Wow, you're practically glowing. You must be happy about something, right #player_name#?///[playful]I know it's because I'm around. You really do perk up when I'm around, don't you?","[happy]You're lucky that you have such a good grasp on the concept of self-reliance. I would never have given a less independent cat a chance.///[blushing]I have no idea what the future of our relationship looks like, but so far, so good! We've found a good balance I think.","[playful]Have you been working on yourself lately, #player_name#? I can tell. You seem a lot more confident.///[happy]Hey now, don't get embarrassed! It's not a bad thing to take some time to acknowledge and celebrate progress.","[neutral]Hey, tell me something. There's no doubt safer places to live than the Wildwood, right? But you picked here to settle down.///[playful]I know why I came here. I'm not afraid of a little adventure and challenge in my life.///[thinking]That must be a common trait between the two of us. There's a lot of those, it seems.","[blushing]This is a good thing we've got going. I could happily live the rest of my life like this.///[playful]A quick visit from my favorite cat, #player_name#, then a couple hours to work on myself and gather some herbs and hunt some critters.///[neutral]I can't think of a more satisfying way to spend the day.","[sad]I'm... not sure what you want.///[sad]I'm... not sure what I want, either.","[playful]Hey, you're looking kinda cute today.///[happy]I can't stop thinking about how perfect our wedding was. It was such a lovely day. You had fun, right #player_name#?","[blushing]Oh! Don't mind me, I'm sort of distracted right now. I've been trying to figure out how everything works with this marriage thing.///[neutral]Life's going to be different now, huh? I hope it doesn't change too much.","[playful]I'm usually in such a hurry to head out and do stuff, but I can't think of anything I'd like to do more than snuggle up with you, #player_name#.///[shocked]But I know you've got a lot on your plate, so I don't want to mess up your schedule!///[happy]Let me know if you find some down time.","[neutral]Say, I've been going through your stuff. Hope you don't mind now that it's our shared property and all.///[playful]You could use a helping hand when it comes to organization! Maybe if I find some time I'll sort it all out.","[blushing]Is this how every morning is going to be? Waking up next to you makes me feel so energized and ready to tackle my day.///[happy]You've made me a more joyful cat, #player_name#. I feel a new sense of purpose. I have to provide for more than just myself now!","[playful]Hey, is that [green]Catnip[/green] I smell in your fur?///[happy]Now don't be greedy, share some with me!",[neutral]I've been in the mood for fish lately. I might head down to the beach sometime and try to catch a [green]Mackerel[/green] for dinner.///[playful]I always like wandering on the beach. You can get some really good fighting practice if you pester a couple crabs. Keeps you sharp!,"[happy]What have you got on your mind, #player_name#? I'm sure a #leader_title# like you has a ton of stuff to do.///[blushing]I'm flattered that you find me worthy of your time, but I have a long list of things to do too. Let's meet back up in a couple hours and catch up, ok?","[neutral]I don't know what I did to deserve your kindness. You treat me so well, #player_name#. If every cat could be like you, the world would be a brighter place.",[happy]Yesterday I was wandering in the woods and I found this [green]Marigold[/green] flower that looked just like you. You should have seen it!///[playful]It was the exact shape of your face. I didn't pick it because I thought it was funny. Maybe you'll stumble across it.,"[neutral]I must have eaten something wrong yesterday because last night I had the strangest dream.///[thinking]We were walking along the riverbanks together and I saw a pretty shiny rock, so I stooped over to grab it with my teeth.///[shocked]When I looked up, you were in the middle of the river flailing your paws wildly, so I swam over to save you.///[neutral]But when I entered the water, it all turned into mud, and I sank down into it until it covered my eyes and I couldn't see.///[shocked]I kept sinking and sinking and sinking until eventually I fell out the bottom side of it and into a giant pile of multicolored flowers.///[happy]Then I woke up! What do you think it could mean?","[thinking]I've always considered myself a solitary creature, so when you came along with that [green]Red Rose[/green], I was shocked to say the least.///[neutral]It hadn't really entered my mind that you might have a crush on me. I didn't think about it much. To be honest, it was the first time that I realized that I liked you too.///[happy]I'm glad I said yes! It was a bit of an impulse decision, but I couldn't help but wonder what could have been if I let the opportunity pass me by.///[thinking]It's funny how small moments like that can have such a massive impact on your future.","[neutral]I remember when I got to the age when it seemed like all my friends started spending all their time chasing down whoever they thought was cute.///[playful]I was still chasing down mice and squirrels! I didn't have time for any of that romantic stuff.///[thinking]As the years went by and the others all paired up, I couldn't help but ponder if I made a mistake. For the most part, they seemed happy.///[neutral]I know now that was a silly thought. It's more important to be true to yourself. From experience, I can see how all the pieces fit together if you act authentically.///[blushing]It certainly worked out for me!","[thinking]When I go out foraging in the wilds, I have a lot of alone time on my paws. I get lost in thought sometimes and forget to look out for herbs.///[shocked]Hey, if you ever see me staring blankly off into space, don't make fun of me, ok?///[playful]I know you wouldn't do that. That's why I love you.","[neutral]Seems like most cats have a lot of friends. Close friends, even.///[thinking]I think I'm happy to get by with just one or two. I like having my inner circle, but it can be a really small circle. I'm happy with that.///[blushing]Even an inner circle of one is ok when it's you! Love you, #player_name#.","[blushing]I love you more than I love the taste of [green]Peppermint[/green].///[shocked]Oh shoot, that sounded so much more romantic in my head. It sounds kinda stupid when you say it out loud, huh.///[blushing]Hey, at least I tried. You get what I mean.","[happy]You're a great looking cat, #player_name#, but there's plenty of reasons that I'm attracted to you aside from how nice you look.///[blushing]You're so intelligent and capable. I feel like I learn so much just by being around you. I've certainly learned more about myself from our relationship.///[playful]Surely you've learned a thing or two from me as well?","[neutral]I can tell you care a lot about me, #player_name#. You always give the best gifts. It lets me know that you understand me well.///[thinking]How'd you get so good at it? I never was good at picking things out for others.///[shocked]I'd get really stressed out whenever my parents' [rainbow]birthdays[/rainbow] would roll around because I never knew what to give them.///[thinking]You know what they say though, it's the thought that counts.",[playful]You're always so quiet. I think that's why I like having you around.///[neutral]You know you're in love with someone when you like spending time together without talking at all.///[happy]It's a unique type of compatibility. I haven't felt that with anybody else.,[neutral]I'm probably going to go exploring today. There was a good smell coming from a pine tree grove that I wanted to check out soon. You wanna tag along?,"[neutral]Hey, your kittens all seem like really nice kids. But can you tell them that if they see me out and about not to approach?///[thinking]I'm usually hunting and I don't want my prey to scurry off. I was tracking a [green]Vole[/green] yesterday when #npc_name_kittenthree# interrupted me. The critter heard your kid and ran away.///[neutral]Again, no offense, they're all great kids. Just easier for me to hunt when there's no children around.",[thinking]I've been tracking this weird scent that I thought was a [green]Mouse[/green] all around the area...///[shocked]Turns out it was just you!,"[neutral]I'm flattered that you want to speak with me, but I'm kind of in the middle of something.///[happy]It's nothing personal, but the fewer cats around the fewer chances my prey has to detect me. You understand?","[thinking]This is the best time of day to catch prey unaware. I come out here late every night to scoop up the critters that assume all of us cats have gone to bed.///[neutral]It's always so quiet at night. Lets me develop my sneaking skills a bit easier, too.///[thinking]Easier to work on that kind of stuff when your ears are more sensitive to sound.",[neutral]I found some strange new flower the other night while I was out exploring. I might drop by and see if #npc_name_alabaster# knows anything about it.,"[angry]Just as I was about to close in on a tasty looking [green]Cardinal[/green], #npc_name_elli# came by and shouted my name. Shouted loud enough to scare off the bird!///[shocked]I had to act happy to see them, but deep down inside I was pretty mad about it.///[neutral]I'm still looking for a meal to replace that [green]Cardinal[/green]. Haven't had much luck. I'm so hungry!",,,,,,"[neutral]Keep up your resolve, #player_name#.

I feel better now.///[playful]If you ever need someone to unload on you'll know where to find me, m'kay?","[happy]I like sharing a second-hand rumor as much as the next cat, but sometimes you gotta get out there and make your own stories.

Fine. Whatever.///[hiss][thinking]Not really how I wanted to spend my day, but I guess I gotta handle this now. Ugh. Gross.///[angry]You're a real piece of work, #player_name#.

There's so many things I'd do with that kind of power.///[playful][purr]First and foremost, I'd make it so that every cat has to hunt for me on my [rainbow]birthday[/rainbow]. I'm not doing the dirty work just to get a bite to eat on my own special day!",[thinking]Where do you think #npc_name_coco# keeps all those [green]Mice[/green] for the games? In their den?///[playful]It must have taken a lot of hard work to round them all up and get them out to the arena. Glad it's not my job!,[happy]I like to hang back and listen to the conversations happening at events like this. You can learn some pretty interesting things!///[thinking]If you only knew the rumor I heard about #npc_name_spark#... It's a juicy one!,"[neutral]You wanna know a secret? I heard some cats talking about #npc_name_theforestguardian#.///I heard two cats hid in the hallways of the Temple and watched for a couple of hours to see what would happen.///[thinking]Apparently #npc_name_theforestguardian# just sit there at the Temple perfectly still until someone wanders in to talk to them. That's creepy, right?",[playful]I heard #npc_name_coco# sometimes loses track of the score during the festival games. How do they know how many [red]Festival Tokens[/red] to hand out at the end?,"[shocked]I was eavesdropping and I heard you have a secret admirer that isn't even me! It's making me kind of jealous, hon. Do you know anything about that?",[shocked]#player_name#! You'll never believe the rumor I just overheard!///[thinking]I heard the Moles in the mines take all the Mole Cash they earn and exchange it for Mews at a favorable rate. It's all a racket!,"[playful]I heard that #npc_name_krampy# has a special mask they only bring out to the festival. It's just like their other mask but a little bit scarier looking.///[thinking]But I don't know, I think the lighting is just different out here at night. What do you think?","[thinking]You'll never believe what I just overheard. Apparently somebody went out hunting during a meteor shower and super rare prey was popping up left and right!///[thinking]It sounds like they were getting extra [green]lucky[/green]. You don't think there's some cosmic connection between us cats and the sky, do you hon?","[happy]Oh, I can't wait 'til we're home together in the den and I can share everything I've heard about every cat here at the festival.///[playful]Believe me, there's some really really juicy stuff to talk about!",[playful]Rumor has it that #npc_name_ember# gets all of the merchandise for their shop for dirt cheap through a secret supplier.///[thinking]I once saw a giant shipment of cargo boxes outside the shop at 3 AM. By the time the sun came up all the boxes were gone and nowhere to be found. So maybe it's true?,[thinking]Rumor has it that some cats don't even like [green]Catnip[/green]. Can you believe that? I can't imagine.,"[blushing]What a year we've had together, huh hon? Let's make next year even better, m'kay?","[shocked]I'm like, swamped with stuff that needs doing. My list keeps getting longer and longer. It's like this at the start of every new year.///[neutral]Can't imagine if I were in your shoes and I was #leader_title_with_article# on top of it all. Yikes. What's that like?","[happy]I finished up my spring cleaning a couple days ago and now I can kick back and relax. Nothing beats a clean den, am I right?///[thinking]Maybe I'll go shopping later. I've been meaning to buy a new dresser.","[shocked]I do try to keep the area around my den clear of weeds with my claws, but in this summer heat it all seems to grow so quickly.///[shocked]Sorry if it looks a bit messy. I'm doing my best, m'kay?","[happy]Hey hon, did you drop a couple [yellow]Mews[/yellow] around here? I found them in the weeds.///[neutral]No? Well then I suppose I'll keep them for myself. Might buy a bite to eat with this.",[neutral]Everything looks so orange and brown. Do you think it'll be much longer before the first snow starts to fall?,"[thinking]There was frost on the ground this morning, which means it's time for me to start collecting some thicker bedding moss for when winter arrives.///[happy]I like to stay nice and warm when I'm sleeping!","[neutral]Sure is cold, isn't it hon? I think the snow is really pretty.///[thinking]I heard a rumor that some cats know how to walk on top of the snow without leaving footprints. Isn't that neat? How do you think they do it?","[shocked]I'm ready for winter to be over, m'kay? Can't you like, ask #npc_name_theforestguardian# to make it go away or something? You're #leader_title_with_article#, you should be able to.",This is #npc_name_rosemary#'s den. They wouldn't appreciate you walking in uninvited.///It's impossible to see anything at all through the door. It's so dark in there!,"[happy]A cat's home is their castle! Or so I've heard it said. And this is mine! What do you think, hon?///[neutral]It's taken a lot of hard work to decide on a style. My tastes change pretty often so I find myself redecorating whenever that happens.","[neutral]My den is very comfortable for me. I like it just like this.///[thinking]Do you keep your den clean or do you keep it messy, #player_name#?","[neutral]Oh, that painting? I forgot I even owned that. It sat in storage for the longest time at my old place but after I moved here to the Wildwood I figured I might as well display it somewhere.///[playful]I think it fits the space nicely. And if you disagree I don't want to hear it, m'kay?",[thinking]It's a bit drafty still. I think there's a hole in the wall near the front of the den. I'll get that patched up next time I'm at the store.,"[neutral]I'm not accustomed to having visitors. I didn't grow up following all the proper rules of etiquette and all that. I don't know what I'm supposed to do as the host.///[neutral]I assume you aren't staying long, otherwise I'd offer some refreshments. If I would have known you were coming I would have prepared better.","[shocked]Gosh, now that we're dating my den just feels underwhelming compared to yours. Maybe we should hang at your place next time, m'kay?","[neutral]I'm glad you didn't pick me based on my living arrangements. It's a work in progress. I've got a lot of projects planned for the den, I just need to find the time to do them.","[neutral]Watch where you're walking, there's some roots poking through the floor.///[thinking]I know where all of them are by memory, but I forget that houseguests probably don't know about them unless I mention it.","[shocked]Oh, I haven't dusted in ages! You can see it all floating through the air. It's funny how you notice things differently when you have a visitor.","[neutral]I'm pretty much all unpacked. It took ages to move all those boxes in and out of the den and get everything set up how I want it, but here we are.///[playful]It's almost a carbon-copy of my old living situation. I put all the furniture in the same spots to mimic how it was before I moved here.","[sad]Gosh, it is way too early for me to be up and moving. I'm going back to bed, m'kay?",[thinking]I couldn't sleep so here I am. But my brain still isn't fully awake. Maybe it'll wake up soon.,"[neutral]Nothing like an early start to really make your day productive, huh #player_name#? We must have had the same idea.","[thinking]Phew, I'm getting sleepy. Still have a couple of errands to run before I turn in for the night though. Can't go to bed on an empty stomach.","[neutral]You make sure you're getting enough rest, m'kay #player_name#? Wouldn't want our #leader_title# to be sleep deprived, now would we?",[sad]I was fast asleep then I heard a loud noise outside. I tried looking around for what caused it but I couldn't figure it out. Now I'm just awake and can't fall back asleep.,"[neutral]There's not a cloud in the sky. I think that's a good omen, m'kay?///[thinking]Sometimes I like to try to see shapes in the clouds. The shapes I see tell me how my day is going to go.///[neutral]I know it's silly and not real, but it's fun. You should try it sometime, hon.","[shocked]Gosh, this fog sure is thick. I tried to bat it away with my paws but it's way too dense for that.","[sad]Aww, my fur is going to get soaked if I spend much time outside today. It's really coming down, isn't it hon?",[happy]Sure is sweet of you to come and say hello on a cold day like today. We all have lots to do when the snow is coming down. Gotta prepare for night.,"[shocked]Gosh, we'll be lucky if all of town doesn't wash away in the wind and rain we're having! Do you think the sun will ever return, #player_name#?","[angry][hiss]Brrr! I can hardly feel my nose! I've about had it with this winter business, m'kay?///[thinking]Gonna be quite a task to dig out from all of this snow... Ugh. I'm getting mad just thinking about it. What did we do to deserve this?","[neutral]Wow, judging from the look of you that must have been a pretty big fight you got into, huh?///[playful]I want details! I want to know all about it.///[thinking][purr]Wait 'til everyone else hears about this story...","[shocked]Hey hon, it's certainly not my place, but have you been eating OK? We all need you strong and healthy to manage #colony_title_with_article#, m'kay?",[angry]Are you serious right now? I still don't have it in my heart to forgive you for what you did. I probably never will.,"[neutral]You'll never guess what #npc_name_elli# told me yesterday. Apparently they were walking around the forest and found a tree stump with a [red]paw shape[/red] carved perfectly onto the top.///[thinking]Weird, am I right? What do you think is up with that?","[neutral]I'll have you know that there is nothing more humiliating than being stung by a bee.///[shocked]I stumbled across a [green]beehive[/green] as I was wandering out in the fields and got into a nasty fight with a giant striped bumblebee. It stuck its stinger right on the tip of my nose.///[shocked]I ran as fast as I could back to town but my face was already swelling pretty bad before I made it to the clinic for a check-up. I looked awful, hon!","[neutral]I've been thinking about heading down to the store and buying some new dining chairs. I like to eat my meals in comfort.///[shocked]Some cats just toss their prey on the ground and chow down. That's gross! Don't you think so, hon?","[thinking]Gosh, I've really got to go out and get to know the neighbors a bit more.///[neutral]I like staying at home and napping as much as the next cat, but where else am I going to learn all about what's going on in town if I don't talk to anybody, huh?///[thinking]You'll keep me in the loop, won't you hon? I knew I could count on you.","[happy]#npc_name_coco# told me the funniest thing. Apparently you two have worked together pretty closely for a while now, huh?///[neutral]I'll bet you know all there is to know about #npc_name_coco#.///[neutral][purr]That cat's got a real guarded personality, I can't figure them out for the life of me. But you can probably fill me in, can't you #player_name#?///[playful]C'mon, just one fun fact. You can do it, I know you can! Spill the beans. I'll wait.","[neutral]I'm starting to get my new schedule down. I've got a route I walk every morning and say hello to every cat I cross.///[thinking]Most days it's the same folks out and about, but this morning I didn't see #npc_name_krampy# anywhere. Weird, huh? Do you know what's up with that?","[playful]Oh, sorry #player_name#, I'm still cracking up about this joke that #npc_name_ember# told me yesterday. You wanna hear it?///[happy]'How do you know when you've crossed a...' wait, that's not it. Hold on.///[thinking]...Ah! 'What do you get when you mix a cat...' No no, that's not right either. Arrgh!///[sad][hiss]I can't remember how it goes. I'd hate to spoil the punchline. You'll just have to ask #npc_name_ember# about it later if you really want to know, m'kay?","[shocked]#npc_name_spark# came up with that mischievous little glint in their eyes, you know the one. Then they handed me a [green]Marigold[/green].///[angry]A [green]Marigold[/green]! Of all things. Surely they know that I hate [green]Marigolds[/green], right? What do you think it could mean?///[sad]Must just be a stupid little prank, right hon?","[neutral]You know, we really need to start up a social club around here. A place where we can get together once a month and chat and talk about the news.///[thinking]This town is lacking a certain... high society element, you know what I mean? I think it could really use an organizer for such a club, don't you?///[shocked]Who, me? No, I could never run something like that. I don't want to put on the events, I just want to partake, m'kay?","[neutral]I've got a cousin who gets into all sorts of trouble. Sometimes I get letters from my cousin.///[thinking]'Hey buddy, help a struggling cat out,' things of that nature.///[shocked]If my cousin can get into a mess like that, then surely they can get themselves out, right?///[neutral]But I do love receiving the letters. I can't resist reading all the stories they've conjured up to make me feel bad for them. They're pretty good at it. Quite the imagination in that one!","[thinking]Let's see, it's day #day_number# of #season#... Yep, that means it's my day off.///[happy]I can do whatever I want! I always try to schedule one or two days off per season. Helps me to relax and reset. It's like a mini-vacation, except I stay home and do nothing.///[playful]Little rituals like that keep life interesting, don't you think #player_name#?","[neutral]Tell me hon, what's a day in the life of #leader_title_with_article# like?///[neutral]Like, it's #timestamp# right now. Tell me what your typical #timestamp# looks like when you're not here chatting with me.///[happy]Must be nice to be your own boss!","[neutral]You ever go down to the beach? I like it 'cause the sun reflects off the ground and it's warmer than other places, but then I get sand in all my toes and I have to shake them out.///[thinking]Honestly I'm not sure if it's worth the hassle. Plus those [green]Crabs[/green] sure do like to come after you if they spot you walking along the beach.","[neutral]You look like you're deep in thought, hon. Maybe I can offer some advice? Only if you share what's on your mind.///[thinking]I promise, I'm a good listener. I listen to every cat every day. I soak it all in and I don't even judge them for what they have to say.///[neutral]That's what makes me a good person. So c'mon, you can tell me! What's going on in your head?","[playful]I heard through the rumor mill that you've been on some interesting adventures lately. Apparently some cat spotted you wandering [i]preeeetty[/i] far from home, yeah?///[happy]What's it like out there? What were you up to? I'm sure you had a good reason for straying in the wilderness.","[happy]Every time I hear your name come up in conversation I hear nothing but good things about you.///[neutral]Apparently most of the other cats think you're like, super strong or something. They look up to you in battle you know. You're like, our fearless #leader_title#, m'kay?","[neutral]I finally feel like I'm all settled in. I've gotten used to my life here in the Wildwood and I intend to stay put for a very, very long time.///[happy]That's mostly thanks to you, hon. You've been a very kind neighbor to me. Thanks for being such a friend.","[playful]Every cat needs something to look forward to, don't you think? I'm looking forward to eating this [green]Hare[/green] later. I've been saving it to make it special.///[happy]You got anything you're looking forward to, hon? You can share with me, I'd be happy to hear all about it.","[happy]You ever wake up and feel all warm and cozy? I've had that feeling all day. Can't shake it. No idea why, either.","[neutral]I'm glad I moved here. There's a wonderful sense of community here, know what I mean?///[playful]Our town feels very tight-knit. I'm honored to be a small part of it.","[thinking]It's hard for me to explain my feelings sometime, do you know what I mean? I just feel kind of numb and weird.///[sad]I think I need a little alone time, m'kay #player_name#?","[blushing]When I packed up and moved out here I never dreamed I'd get involved with #leader_title_with_article#.///[happy]To be clear I didn't really have much of a plan. I guess I was just looking for a better life out there somewhere in the wilderness.///[playful]And hey, lately life's been pretty great, so maybe it'll stay that way. I'm glad I came here.","[happy]Oh #player_name#, we have [i]got[/i] to go on a date sometime. Somewhere romantic, with good food and good views and all of that.///[blushing]I'll let you work out all the details. That's your job since you asked me out first, hon.","[playful]I don't know if this spoils the magic or whatever but I wanted you to know that I kind of had a suspicion that you were going to ask me out when you did.///[playful]I'd heard a rumor around town about you having a little crush on me.///[happy]Oh #player_name#, your cheeks are turning so red. It's ok, don't get embarrassed! I think it's cute.","[neutral]Are you here with some grand romantic gesture to sweep me off my paws?///[blushing]Gosh, that would be nice... I'd imagine you could think up some pretty good ideas. Might as well start planning #player_name#.","[playful]You're so cute, #player_name#. Sometimes I have to tease you because I love it when you get all flustered.///[blushing]I'm not doing it to be mean, I promise. M'kay?",[neutral]It's been a long time since I was last in a relationship like this. I took several years off from dating after my last one ended.///[thinking]I got really absorbed in doing my day-to-day thing and sort of shutting off that side of my emotions. It's taking some real energy on my part to bring it back online.,"[happy]So when are we going to go on a date again? I'll get all cleaned up and rub some flowers on my fur so I smell real good, m'kay?///[thinking]I like that part about dating. I get plenty of excuses to look sharp and be the best version of myself. I imagine other cats get jealous when they see me looking so good.///[shocked]I know I used to!","[blushing]So #player_name#, when you tell me about your job, I only want to hear all of the good stuff.///[shocked]I know there's probably plenty of boring details about taxes and tariffs and paperwork and all that comes with being #leader_title#, but I only want the juicy details!///[playful]You know, stuff about other cats and what they said and what they did. The more scandalous the better.///[happy][purr]I [b]live[/b] for that kind of stuff, m'kay?","[blushing]I've been thinking a lot about the two of us and what makes us each unique. I think I'm definitely the more talkative one, do you know what I mean?///[neutral]Sometimes it probably feels like I'm chatting your ear off. I hope you can get used to it, 'cause this is me!///[happy]I think I need a social outlet. Someone to tell all about my day. It helps me to process things somehow when I say them out loud.///[blushing]You're honestly a great listener, #player_name#. I appreciate that about you.","[playful]You ever need to go and like, sit under a tree and feel the wind for a bit? Hard to describe but sometimes I get the need to connect with nature.///[thinking]I think there's something spiritual going on there. I feel better after I answer the call and go sniff some tree bark or touch some grass or whatever.///[shocked]It's like a weird itch that needs scratching. I don't know, maybe my brain is just broken.///[blushing][hiss]Gosh, I shouldn't have shared that at all. You can forget it, m'kay hon?","[playful][hiss]Ever since I was a young kitten I've had this instinct inside me that lets me detect if a cat is a good one or a bad one, do you know what I mean?///[neutral]One look is all it takes and I can usually tell. My gut is rarely wrong.///[blushing][purr]I knew from the moment we met that you were one of the good ones. I feel so safe around you, hon.","[shocked]Yesterday #npc_name_spark# pointed out that I speak totally different when I'm talking about another cat that's not part of the conversation.///[thinking]They said I get really really quiet, almost a whisper. I'd never noticed that before. Now I can't stop thinking about it.///[blushing]Had you noticed, #player_name#? Gosh, I feel so self-conscious right now.///[angry]I wish #npc_name_spark# had just kept their mouth shut!",[thinking]I ran into a [green]Rat[/green] once when I was a young kitten. It kind of sat there and stared at me and I stared back.///[thinking]We didn't move much. But I caught a glimpse of something in its eyes.///[neutral]You ever see a creature that has an almost cat-like quality to their eyes? Like it's got a real intelligence and a soul and all of that. It gave me a really uncanny vibe.///[neutral]I've always thought that about [green]Rats[/green]. I don't hunt them because I feel bad for them.,"[shocked]#player_name#, I've been craving a good [green]Crow[/green] all day! Maybe you can bring me one tomorrow? Pretty please? I would love that.///[happy]Gosh, I'm getting so hungry just thinking about it. I'd love to dig into a nice [green]Crow[/green]. They're like [green]Catnip[/green] to me.","[neutral]I stopped by the clinic to chat with #npc_name_krampy# earlier and I heard a wild story that I knew I had to share with you!///[shocked]But now I can't remember it at all! I spent, like, all day yesterday trying to remember it. It was such a good story.///[sad]Anyways, I'll let you know if it comes back to me.","[shocked]I sure do hope that you like [green]Moths[/green], #player_name#, because if we get married I'm bringing my whole collection along with me.///[thinking]I collect a couple dozen every year and add them to my stash. I've got a crate that's practically overflowing with [green]Moths[/green].///[happy]Of course I'll be happy to share one or two with you from time to time. I like how fuzzy they feel. Sometimes I carry one with me throughout the day.","[thinking]I don't think my brain functions at full capacity if I don't have fresh air. I've got to step outside once in a while and reset.///[neutral]I usually just stand there, close my eyes, take several deep breaths, and count to one hundred. I've never seen anyone else do that, but it works for me, you know what I mean?","[happy]I love that I can just sort of vibe with you. Like, with most cats I talk politely with and we share a couple details about our day and then we go our separate ways.///[happy][purr]But with you it's different, hon. I feel like I can be more authentic around you. There's no need to put on a show. It's just comfortable.","[blushing]I'm so glad I decided to give you a chance, #player_name#. There were a couple reservation I had about getting back into a relationship.///[shocked]None of my reservations had to do with you, mind you. I was worried about myself more than anything, do you know what I mean?///[blushing][purr]But things have gone so swimmingly ever since you brought me that [green]Red Rose[/green]. I think I love you, hon!///[blushing]Is that OK that I said that?","[blushing]You are too sweet. I keep telling all my friends about all the gifts you've given me and the romantic things you've said to me.///[happy][purr]Gosh, I've fallen pretty hard for you, #player_name#.///[happy]I love it when you're around because I love spending time with you. I know you've got stuff to do but don't stay away too long, m'kay?","[sad]Oh, don't mind me hon. I'm just in a bad mood today. I'll probably get over it soon enough, m'kay?","[playful]They say that behind every great #leader_title# is a great spouse. I hope I can make that statement true in your life, #player_name#.///[happy]While you're busy managing the important high-level stuff, I'll be on the ground collecting intel for you. Nothing will happen in this #colony_title# without me knowing all about it!///[blushing]Of course I'll report it all back to you in story form. You know how I am about those sort of things, hon.","[thinking]Back when I was younger and chore-time came around I used to sneak away and dip my paws into my parents' [green]Catnip[/green] storage.///[happy]I knew it was wrong of me, but it was fun, you know what I mean?///[neutral]Nowadays I'm much more responsible. I promise I'll help out with the chores around the den. And I only get into the [green]Catnip[/green] to help me wind down before bed.","[shocked]Oh #player_name#, I was meaning to ask you, is the bedding I laid down too thick? I like to keep it toasty when I sleep.///[neutral]If it's too much for you we can always find a solution that will work for both of us, m'kay?","[playful]Word around town is that our wedding was the best party most of these cats have ever been to. Everything came together so nicely, didn't it hon?///[happy]The decorations, the guest list, the venue... Gosh, I can't believe it all went off without a hitch. What a gorgeous day.","[thinking]How big was your family growing up, #player_name#? Did you have lots and lots of siblings or was it just you?///[neutral]I don't have a lot of siblings but I have [i]lots[/i] of cousins. We used to see each other pretty often.///[happy]Not often enough to a young version of myself. I loved spending time with them.///[thinking]Now they're all out living their adult lives and doing their adult things and we rarely ever see each other. Kinda sad, don't you think?","[neutral]Oh hon, your snoring has been pretty bad lately. Also, I might have mentioned that to a couple of cats around town. Wanted to give you a heads-up.///[thinking]I only mentioned it to a few trustworthy cats and I told them in confidence. Don't worry, I'm sure they'll keep your secret safe.","[shocked][hiss]Last week #npc_name_coco# called me [purple]'the town gossip'[/purple] and I still can't get over it! Can you believe the nerve of that cat??///[thinking]I mean, I like chatting about others as much as the next cat, but a gossip? No, surely not me. I'm very careful who I give out my intel to. I'm responsible with the information I receive.///[angry]Maybe you can have a word with #npc_name_coco#, m'kay? It was rude and they should have known that.","[happy]Sorry, am I smiling? I can't stop smiling today. I just keep thinking about our story and how you fell for me and everything.///[blushing]It all kind of feels surreal, do you know what I mean? I love you, hon. I'm so glad you found me.","[thinking]Gosh, there sure is a lot to do around the den. It's cleaning day, in case you didn't know. Well, it is for me anyways.///[shocked]I probably should have told you that earlier. If you already have plans then by all means you do what you need to do.///[neutral]Wouldn't be fair of me to assume you'd drop everything to knock out my priorities when you have your own, hon.","[blushing]Oh gosh, please tell me you didn't notice my paws. I was just chowing down on some [green]Blackberries[/green] I had stashed away for a snack.///[shocked]Now they're stained [purple]purple[/purple]! Is it really bad? I should go try to wash it off in the river. That's super embarrassing.",[neutral]I spent an hour dusting the den this morning. Did you notice a difference? No more particles floating around the air when you walk around.///[happy]My nose sure notices a difference. No more sneezing for me. The air is so clean and pure!,"[happy]This morning I woke up, walked around the den, and had to sit down for a moment. I'm so happy that this is my life, hon.///[playful]You've really brought a lot of light into my heart. I was so focused on only myself for so many years. At first it was hard to open up and be vulnerable.///[happy][purr]Now I can't imagine living any other way. I love you #player_name#!","[neutral]My daily experience is probably very different from what other cats go through.///[thinking]I go out and talk to just about everybody that's willing to chat. I take in a lot of information. It's like drinking from a firehose.///[neutral]Then I have to somehow process all of that information and distill it into just the important stuff so that I don't forget anything that matters.///[thinking]You know, birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, important happenings around town. I try my best to keep track of it all so I won't forget and hurt anybody's feelings.///[happy]I think I'm uniquely skilled at keeping tabs on everything.

We aren't very natural swimmers, you know.///[shocked]If you're not careful, you could drown!","[thinking]I'm supposed to be practicing my 'customer service' voice, but that doesn't sound like fun at all. I'd rather just talk to people normally.","[angry]All I want to do is to play a quick round of hide-and-seek, but nobody's interested in playing. It's not fair!","[thinking]I would love to just run away and explore the world.///[blushing]Perhaps...we could run away together? Nah, that would be ridiculous.///[playful]Forget I said that.","[neutral]What are you up to today, #player_name#? I wouldn't mind shadowing you for an hour or two.

Maybe I'm not ready for a relationship.",[playful]I'm not sure what I expected dating to be like. It's OK I guess.

I was looking forward to seeing you, but now that you are here, I don't know what to say! How has your day been?",[playful]I keep getting teased about being in a relationship.

I guess I'm getting secure in our relationship.///[thinking]This is how cats date, right?","[angry]Sorry, I'm just really fed up with #npc_name_ember# today.

Thank you for letting me rant for a little bit.","[happy]Do you like flowers, #player_name#? I can start to keep an eye out for them when I'm chasing bugs.

We can do anything together.,[happy]What have you been up to today? I've been busy sorting inventory for #npc_name_ember#. I didn't mind the work today.

I was hanging out with #npc_name_kittentwo# recently and they're quite a good storyteller.///[shocked]They have such a good imagination! Something about a dragon and a dog and a moose.

You can't be serious.///[neutral]Oh, you are? I don't have any use for a flower but I take it this means you like me.///[thinking]Hard for me to admit, but I like you too, #player_name#.

It's not so bad when you're here with someone you like spending time with.,[happy]Is this what it feels like to relax? I haven't experienced this feeling in ages.,"[angry]Those games are a scam. I swear, I should have won! Completely rigged.","[neutral]I never liked the feel of pumpkins on my claws. Why any cat would choose to carve one up is beyond my understanding.///[blushing]But if you wanted to, I guess I could try.","[playful]I'll try to win you a prize, #player_name#. No promises.",[shocked]This is miserable. Who wants to spend all day out in the cold anyways?,[thinking]My nose is cold.

Hopefully as the sun comes out and warms everything up everybody will relax a bit and we'll have peace again.,"[neutral]One of these days, when I'm not so busy, I'd like to go soak up the sun near the river. But my obligation to #colony_full_name_with_article# comes first.",[neutral]Could have sworn I saw some leaves falling from the trees.///[thinking]Or maybe it was just a butterfly. My eyesight's not so good as it once was.,"[thinking]I never liked this time of year. Weather always seems to take a turn for the worst. If you see the sky darken, find shelter immediately.",[neutral]There's a bite to the air now. Sharpens the senses. Keeps you on your toes.,[shocked]It feels like just yesterday we could see the ground. Now look at the state of things! We had better stock up. This could be a bad winter.,[angry]I could actually get things done around here if this blasted snow would stop falling! Hard to focus on anything but hunting when the prey is so scarce.,This is #npc_name_talon#'s den. You have no doubt in your mind that #npc_name_talon# would be angry with you if you set foot inside before getting to know them better.///The interior is sparsely decorated and martial. It looks more like a barracks than a home.,[shocked]I don't normally have visitors. I'm not sure I like it.,[neutral]You got nothing better to do than to come bother me in my own home?

Nor have I ever liked hosting.","[thinking]If this keeps up, I might consider it trespassing. Fair warning, #player_name#.","[shocked]I'm not really sure what you want. I don't think I'd ever come by your den unannounced, #player_name#. I thought that was obvious.","[shocked]Compared to your den, this must seem very martial.///[neutral]I assure you, I only keep things around if they have a clear function to my life. If nothing else, I'd like to think I'm a very pragmatic cat.","[playful]Oh, #player_name#. Thanks for dropping by.///[blushing]I'll admit I'd prefer to spend time together somewhere else. Imagine if somebody saw you walk inside or leave. I wouldn't hear the end of it.","[neutral]Well, this is it. Not a lot to do in here, I'm afraid, aside from sleeping.","[thinking]I don't usually spend much time in here. I consider it more of a barracks than a home. My duties come before my personal comfort, as I'm sure you're aware.","[shocked]Oh, I had something in here to give you, but I seem to have lost it. Maybe I put it under the bed..?///[thinking]I'm sure it'll turn up eventually.","[playful]Up and about early today, eh #player_name#? I respect that. Trouble never sleeps, so we can't let our guard down.",[neutral]A bit chilly this morning. I'm sure it will warm up once the sun is out.,"[thinking]I thought I saw something out in the woods, but it's still too dark to know for sure. Either way, I'll stand guard until I'm sure the coast is clear.",[neutral]I prefer staying up late. Less cats around to bother you when everyone's sleeping.,"[thinking]I'm tired, but I've got some time left in my watch before I turn in. Protecting #colony_title_with_article# is an honor and a privilege.","[angry]By the way, if you heard something earlier, I wasn't snoring. I was just resting my bad eye for a second. #npc_name_talon# does not doze off!","[neutral]They say the most dangerous days are the sunny ones. The nice weather puts everyone at ease.///[thinking]Well, almost everyone. Here's one cat that won't be caught unaware!","[thinking]Be careful as you go today, #player_name#. You never know what might be hiding in the fog.","[neutral]A little rain never hurt anyone. There's much worse things that can happen to a cat than getting soaked. Trust me, I'd know.","[angry]If I'm on edge lately, it's because of this ridiculous snow. Why won't it let up for a bit and melt already? I can't feel my paws.",[thinking]This storm is nothing. I've seen worse. I can handle it.,[angry][hiss]Curse this snow! Even more of the nasty cold stuff is falling today. If it doesn't let up soon we'll be buried in our dens.,"[thinking]Get into a good scrap earlier, #player_name#? You're looking a little battered. I'm always game for a good war story if you've got one.","[thinking]Our hunters have reported that the prey is hard to come by today. I can see it's had an effect on you too, #player_name#. I think I can see your ribs.","[angry][hiss]Oh, so you're a smart one, are you? You'll back off if you know what's good for you.",[neutral]I'm occupied at the moment. I thought that was obvious.,"[angry]You really have a way of irritating me, you know that? If you have something important to say, spit it out.","[thinking]If you think I'd enjoy that, then you clearly don't know the first thing about me.","[neutral]Colonies aren't built and maintained by having casual conversations. There's work that needs doing. Now, if you'll excuse me...","[thinking]I may be elderly, but that doesn't mean I'm useless. Go ahead, try me in a fight, let's see who wins. Any place, any time.","[thinking]So, what makes you in charge of #colony_full_name_with_article#? If you ask me, #npc_name_coco# should have that title.",[neutral]Have you scouted the borders today? There can never be enough vigilance over our territory.///[thinking]You can never have too many scouts. Wouldn't want to be caught unprepared for a catastrophe.,"[thinking]If I were in charge of #colony_full_name_with_article#, I'd have a defined schedule for all the scouts, hunters, and guards. Defined routes and shifts. Our safety relies on your efficiency and preparedness.",[angry]Just because I'm old doesn't mean I don't have important responsibilities to attend to!///[thinking]Cats like you think that all us old folk do is sit around and gossip. I don't have time for that nonsense.,[neutral]Administration is just bossing people around. It's the grunts like me who do the real heavy lifting around here. Don't you forget it.,"[neutral]If you ever doubt my worth to this #colony_title#, refer to my scar. If that doesn't say dedication and loyalty, I don't know what does.",[thinking]Young cats these days have no respect for their elders. I learned respect back when I was a kitten. Things were better back then.,[neutral]Some cats just want to run around catching bugs and swimming in the lake. They don't understand the sacrifices that I've had to make so that they could enjoy their lives.///[angry]Don't they see how much more important #colony_full_name_with_article# is than their own wants and desires?,"[neutral]I've been told I've become more moody as I've gotten older. I don't see it that way.///[thinking]Feels like I've stayed the same and the whole world has gotten worse around me. If I'm on edge, it's because I see what they all don't. I've got to keep a clear head so that I can pick up their slack and keep things running smoothly.","[angry]I've done my time serving my #colony_title#, unlike these young rapscallions. And I continue to serve because it's the right thing to do.///[thinking]Sometimes I think if I were in charge, I'd make every cat spend a couple years fighting out on the borders. There'd be a lot more understanding and respect if they did.","[neutral]Between you and me, my health has been on the decline for a while now.

I trust you will not let us down.///[neutral]Don't share that with anyone. I don't want them to think I'm weak. I'm not weak.","[playful]I'd consider you a comrade in arms, #player_name#. You're one of the few cats around here that has truly earned my respect, and I'd like to think I've earned yours too.///[neutral]This #colony_title# is in good hands with you behind the wheel.","[neutral]Look, I know I can be pretty cold and distant. If I seemed a bit gruff when we first met, I apologize. Most cats are rotten to their core, and I had misjudged you.///[thinking]What's past is passed. Water under the bridge.","[happy]Had a good time earlier. There was a scrappy cat poking at the border, and I got a kick out of chasing them off, tail tucked between their scrawny little legs!///[playful]Wish you could've been there with me. Got my adrenaline pumping!",[playful]There was a mischief of [green]Rats[/green] near the outskirts last night. I chased them to their burrows and kicked them in.///[happy]Those vermin won't see the light of day again!,[sad]I don't have anything to say to you. I don't know what you expected.,"[playful]You look well today. Hale and fit for battle, as you should be.

I spent years studying the subtle art of positioning on the battlefield. I can teach you a few tricks, if you'd like.","[blushing]I have a lot of respect for your sense of obligation to #colony_full_name_with_article#, #player_name#. You work harder than anyone else here.///[happy]Except for me, of course!","[neutral]You seem like a cat with a lot of goals, #player_name#. A cat of ambition.///[thinking]I don't think too far ahead. I know my place and my role, and I seek to fulfill it until I meet my end.","[thinking]Some cats around here have no respect. They think I'm too direct, too bold.///[angry]What else should I be? Everything else is cowardice.","[neutral]I thought I was too old for this dating stuff. It's a young cats' game, that's what they say.///[playful]If I'm honest, I still doubt whether or not it's a good idea. If you haven't noticed, I have a very hard time letting others get too close.","[thinking]We might be dating, but I hope you aren't trying to change me. I'm stuck in my ways, and I prefer it that way!

You make the rules, and I enforce them. You set the borders, and I protect them.///It's gratifying to be your right-hand cat.","[playful]I might not be good at most of this relationship nonsense, but at least I'm reliable and dependable.///[thinking]...That's romantic, right?","[neutral]Making the rounds today, #player_name#? It's important to keep an eye on everybody, and often. Never know when dissent might crop up.","[thinking]If you're here to talk about the status of our relationship, I'm not interested. Why can't we just be happy that we have one and leave it at that?///[neutral]I watch all these younger cats get caught up on talking about their feelings and their problems. I see no reason to stoop that low.","[neutral]It's strange. I usually get antsy when I'm around another cat, but it's not that way around you anymore. It doesn't feel any different than when I'm alone.///[playful]That's a good thing, don't worry. I like my own company.","[blushing]When I'm out scouting the borders, I find myself keeping an eye out for things you might like so that I can bring them back to you. It gives me something to do, so don't feel too special.","[neutral]I'll admit, I like spending some time with you every day. But I also need my alone time. You understand?","[blushing]Cats have started making snide remarks at me about our relationship, #player_name#. I used to be so respected around here. Now look at me.","[thinking]I had a dream last night that you and I got into quite the scrap. We were surrounded on all sides by countless enemies, but I knew what I had to do.///[thinking]I fought like a wild animal to protect you from the onslaught, #player_name#. At last I was overcome, and the dream ended. Isn't that odd?",[playful]I haven't felt some of these emotions since I was a kitten.///[shocked]It's not a pleasant experience. I'm too old for this!,"[shocked]I knew you'd be stopping by today, #player_name#, but I still get anxious. Why am I like this? I don't get nervous of anyone!","[blushing]I try not to think about it, because I have more important things to do. But I can't keep myself from wondering what's next for us.///[thinking]I was hoping you could suggest a cure. It's starting to distract me, and distractions are the enemy.","[shocked]Does my fur look OK today? I tried to lick it down, but it won't stay put.///[angry]Wait, what am I saying. Since when have I cared what I look like? Not in a long time, that's for sure.","[angry]You've got a lot of nerve, #player_name#! Keep acting out and see what happens, I dare you.","[playful]Well, our lives have certainly been an adventure. Or at least, more adventurous than I would have liked. But here we are!///[blushing]It's... not as bad as I expected, to be honest. I could probably get used to this.","[neutral]I'm going to take some time to warm up to all of this marriage nonsense. You knew that when you married me, #player_name#.","[blushing]If you felt me brushing up against you last night, I swear it was an accident.///[angry]#npc_name_talon# is not a cuddler!","[neutral]We should really divide our duties around the den. That would be the efficient way to do things, don't you think?///So which chores are you willing to do? I'll keep the bed tidy and pick up the floor. I can't stand living in a messy place.","[happy]My old place was so spartan. Your den is much more comfortable.///I don't have much of an eye for decorating. Also, I don't have much of an eye in general. So I'll leave that to you.","[neutral]My loyalty lies with #colony_full_name_with_article#, but now I also feel the same sense of loyalty to you. I don't know if that makes sense or not. I should probably just stop talking.","[thinking]You're going to have to do most of the hunting for our family, #player_name#. My eyesight isn't what it used to be, obviously.///[angry]I swear those [green]mice[/green] taunt me sometimes! They know I have bad depth perception. Long-tailed freaks.","[neutral]My father told me that if you want other cats to respect you, you've got to act tough. Can't let anybody see your weaknesses. And I agree with that assessment.///[thinking]That's why I'm so sensitive about my old age and my scar. I apologize if I've ever snapped at you over it.","[playful]I got into an awesome fight with a [green]Bat[/green] last night, #player_name#! It flew around the den a few times before I caught it in my claws.///[happy]Wish you could have been there, you would have loved it.","[angry]I'm not as limber as I once was. Makes it harder to swat and dodge.///[thinking]One of these days, I might not return home, you understand #player_name#? You need to be ready for that.","[thinking]My father was the strongest cat I've ever known. Stronger than me, if you'll believe it. And he had a taste for [green]Adders[/green].///One day he brought home a big one. Huge, golden-headed monster. Tongue like a black fork, teeth like a dog.///[thinking]But he also brought home an injury that day. The venom...///[sad]The venom was too much. He didn't make it.///[angry]So, if you ever see an [green]Adder[/green], kill the ugly thing and bring me its corpse! World could do with one less monster.","[neutral]I've been told I'm off-putting and cold. Those don't seem like traits that would make me a prime candidate for marriage, but you must have disagreed.///[blushing]Honestly, I don't think I would marry me. Not really sure what you saw in me. Still kind of confused by the whole thing, if I'm being honest.","[happy]Have you eaten yet, #player_name#? I could really go for a [green]Lizard[/green] right about now. Maybe later I'll make a trek out to where they like to hide and snag me one.","[playful]I try to keep my emotions to myself as a rule of thumb. Hard to do that when you're around though.///[happy]This marriage has brought about many unexpected challenges, but you know me. I'm always up for a good challenge!","[neutral]I know I'm old, but I don't think I'll ever retire. I'll be out there protecting the borders until I keel over dead.///[happy]I was blessed with a large frame and long claws, and I'm going to use them as long as I can.","[happy]If any cat gets on your bad side you just say the word, #player_name#. I can deal with anybody, any time.",[playful]I've always been a very protective cat of the things that I judge to be worth saving. It's every cats duty to ensure that the good things in this world stick around for a while.///[thinking]I know I'd do anything to protect you.///Maybe that's what love is? Heck if I know.,"[neutral]I wish every cat were like you, #player_name#. You're considerate and respectful. Rare traits today, sad as it is!///[happy]I was the last cat that I would have expected to get involved in all this lovey-dovey nonsense. You were too good to pass up on.","[blushing]I'm something of a closed book. I know I don't talk about my past or my feelings much, but I still feel like you truly get me. That's a special thing, #player_name#.","[neutral]Say, if you ever wanted to gain some new stomping grounds for #colony_full_name_with_article#, I know of a soldier who would happily follow your orders.///[happy]Just saying.","[neutral]Congratulations on the birth of your children. I trust you will keep them in line. Children should be taught discipline and order from a young age if they wish to thrive.///[angry]That is how I was raised, and look how I turned out!","[thinking]Oh, good, it's you #npc_name_krampy#. I had something I needed to discuss with you regarding that ache in my back.///[angry][hiss]Wait a minute, you're not #npc_name_krampy#! Do you take me for some kind of idiot??///[angry]Take that mask off right now before I rip it off your face.","[thinking]Don't think just because I'm sitting down that I'm taking a break. No, I would never rest on the job.///[neutral]I'm always ready to pounce into action as soon as it is needed. You'll see.",[neutral]An early start is the only way to begin one's day with efficiency. It sets the tone for a productive morning.///[angry]Sleeping in is for civilians! I pride myself in my disciplined routine.,"[angry][hiss]Hey, mind your own business!

You want to find somebody whose passions are compatible with yours.///[blushing]#npc_name_krampy# and I are both passionate about our careers. That's why we work so well together.,"[shocked]What is it? Is #npc_name_jack# in trouble again??

Alas, it is true.","[thinking]I am not bound in time and place like you, #player_name#.///[thinking]My consciousness can travel between all places and all times as easily as you can walk from one side of this room to the other.///[neutral]I have spent many ages gazing into the distant and unclear future, like an image of the fracturing of light in the many facets of a crystal.///[thinking]There is one common factor in the diverging of all paths, #player_name#. And that factor is you.///[thinking]What could it mean? It is a riddle I have not yet solved.","[happy]I have learned much of the destiny of mortal cats through our friendship, #player_name#.///[playful]And there is still much to learn, I perceive!

I am content that we have found love.","[happy]In my darkest times, I think of you #player_name#. Even a spirit like myself has bad days.///[blushing]Somehow remembering you and your tenderness is enough to raise me out of the darkness.","[thinking]I am greatly troubled in thought, #player_name#. I have thought this through many times, even before we married, but I cannot resolve this concern.///[sad]I am immortal, and my spirit will persist for many long years after you have departed.///[neutral]Therefore, we must make the most of our time together.

You are well known amongst the spirit-folk.///[happy]Your story will be remembered for all time. I can reveal no more.","[neutral]The universe has always hung in a delicate balance between the powers of the spirit-folk and the powers of mortal cats.///[thinking]Yes, you are more powerful than you know. You and all mortal cats. For my kind are very strong but limited in our influence.///[neutral]But you... Mortal cats have no such limits. They can accomplish anything they set their minds to. Some amongst the stars are afraid of mortals, for they fear what they do not understand.///[blushing]I believe we are stronger together. We must work hand-in-hand and watch out for one another.///[blushing]That is why our relationship is so incredible. We can each use our strengths to better the other and shore up one another's weaknesses.","[thinking]Things have not always been how they are now, and they will not remain in their present state forever.///[playful]But you need not concern yourself with such matters. That is for me to deal with. You cannot stop the flow of time anymore than I.///[happy]Focus on what you have today and what you can do tomorrow.","[happy]You now have a litter of your very own, #player_name#. You must be very proud.///[playful]Kittens can be such a joy for mortal cats to raise. I have no doubt you will do an excellent job teaching them the ways of the Wildwood.///[thinking]I share in your joy, for the strength of our community has never been stronger than it is now.","[thinking]Your kittens are growing up strong, are they not? I have foreseen a great fate in each of their futures.///[happy]Does it feel like they are growing up too fast? That is something I have heard from many cats, though I do not fully understand its meaning.///[thinking]How is it that time seems to operate differently for a parent than for others? It is a mystery for which I do not possess the answer. Perhaps you can enlighten me."

It is good for the others to see us together at an event such as this.///[happy]Let all cats know that #npc_name_zephyr# and #player_name# are madly, deeply in love with one another!///[blushing]I will give you a little kiss, for I am not ashamed of this feeling that springs up from within. Like flowing water, it too cannot be contained and will overflow where it pleases.","[playful]Am I cold? No no, not #npc_name_zephyr#. My majestic fur is superior to most cats.///[thinking]Why, are you cold, #player_name#? That does not surprise me.","[playful]It is almost the new year, yes? And there is a tradition around the start of the new year, do you not know?///[blushing]Two cats with hearts entwined... At the stroke of midnight, they must kiss.///[playful]That is my desire, #player_name#. To display my passion for you with a kiss, but not until midnight!///[happy]I see the anxious look on your face, you can hardly wait! But you must. It is no good to ignore tradition.","[blushing]As beautiful as the snowflakes are that fall, they cannot compare to the beauty of my blossom #player_name#.///[thinking]The snow will come and the snow will melt, but the inner beauty of my blossom will not fade with the changing of the seasons.","[thinking]Look now to the flowers that grow wild upon the fields and in the tall grasses. Consider their colors of many vibrant shades as they sway gently in the breeze.///[neutral]I, #npc_name_zephyr#, am the breeze. And the fruit of my labor is the flowers.///[thinking]What then are you, #player_name#?","[playful]If you listen closely, you can hear the music that stirs in the limbs of the tallest trees.///[playful]As the gentle winds pass through their branches, the universe writes a symphony for us to hear.///[neutral]But you cannot hear it if you are not present when it is written.","[neutral]My spirit is much like the heat of summertime. Warm and jovial and generous and good.///[thinking]In my absence, desiring. In my excess, withering. Such is the nature of a cat like myself.","[playful]Do you stretch before you hunt, #player_name#? In this heat it is important that you give you body a chance to prepare itself.///[happy]I find that when I stretch I hunt with the strength of ten cats, instead of my usual strength of nine!","[neutral]A [green]squirrel[/green] crept softly next to my bed this morning as I lay in a haze before wakefulness had fully taken me.///[thinking]I watched it for a while as it scurried about the den, poking its nose into every nook and cranny.///[neutral]Then I let it go, free to wander as it would. For I had gained something profound from watching this [green]squirrel[/green] that was not merely a postponement of my appetite.",[neutral]Winter approaches. It will be upon us soon. My intuition tells me that this year it will be colder and longer than most.///[thinking]We must remember when the frost comes to not let it turn our hearts and our minds to ice as well.///[neutral]There is cold enough for the world to deal with. Let our actions be a source of warmth and light instead.,"[neutral]The air is crisp and clear. I believe the snow has a purifying effect, not only on the atmosphere but on everything it touches.///[thinking]Leaves, stones, rivers... Even cats are not left untouched. How shall this winter change us all?","[thinking]All the world will sigh in relief when the last flake of snow eventually melts.///[shocked]It is only too easy to let down your guard and take too long a break when things make a turn for the better.///[neutral]One must consider their course carefully, lest they stumble their way to an undesirable end.","This is #npc_name_zephyr#'s den. You haven't been invited over, so you should stay outside.///Peering inside, you see a large array of colorful items of every description.","[playful]It is a privilege afforded to very few to set foot inside my personal space. Surely you feel the sense of honor that you have been invited in, no?","[happy]Many months have I spent perfecting my living space. Many things are imported from places you have likely never heard of, nor ever will. Very expensive, I might add.///[happy]Only the highest quality items for #npc_name_zephyr#! A cat of my caliber is deserving of the best. I expect you also understand this, no?","[playful]I keep the lighting low at all times. It is a reflection of myself, as I'm sure you could guess.///[thinking]It simmers at all times on the edge of romance and intrigue, much like myself!","[playful]You are a most polite house guest, #player_name#. It comes as no surprise to me.///[shocked]I know you never would, but please refrain from digging around in my storage! There are things that #npc_name_zephyr# would prefer were never seen by any eyes but my own.","[neutral]Come, #player_name#, let us have a song! Where I am from, we sing when we are invited to another's den.///[thinking]It is one of life's little pleasures to learn a new song from a friend.///[happy]Oh, have I caught you unprepared? I will allow you some time to think. But next time you visit I will be expecting a tune.","[playful]My blossom, you are welcome in my den at any time. I do hope that you will make yourself at home. What is mine is yours.///[happy]If there is any way that I can make you more comfortable, let me know so that I may remedy the fault quickly.","[happy]You are the most honored among honored guests at my den, my blossom.///[playful]I have been saving a [green]Starling[/green] to share with you for just such an occasion as this. It quite a delicacy when prepared correctly, I assure you.///[shocked]Hmm, but now the challenge seems to be locating the errant [green]Starling[/green]... I thought for sure I had put it right in the corner, yet now it is gone.///[happy]No matter, in any case we will make the most of it. I cannot serve you [green]Starling[/green], but we will still enjoy our time together. Of this I have no doubt.","[neutral]Many cats would need to rush around to pickup their houses when their loved one comes to visit, but not #npc_name_zephyr#! My den is always left in good order.///[happy]A well-ordered den is a sign of a well-ordered mind. And #npc_name_zephyr# has one of the best.","[playful]Have you heard any good poems lately that you'd like to recite, #player_name#?///[thinking]I try to keep up with all the latest in the field of poetry, but lately I have fallen woefully behind.///[neutral]There is nothing like a well-spoken poem to spark a little romance. Perhaps one day I will share some with you.","[neutral]You are warm? Yes, I like to keep my den very warm.///[playful]It is quite lovely when returning from a long night of hunting to enter the den and be able to stretch out and relax.///[happy]Just one of life's little pleasures. The more that we can experience, the richer and fuller our days will feel.","[thinking]Yes, it is early, but my clarity of mind does not wax and wane with the hours like it does in lesser cats. No!///[playful]I am every bit as awake and alert as I have ever been.///[thinking]I like to start my mornings out with a hunt. Five or six [green]mice[/green] can be caught before most cats have even begun to stir.","[neutral]There is something about the morning air that makes the flowers of the field smell more fragrant and more robust.///[thinking]Perhaps it is the dew that lithely wanders across their delicate petals?///[neutral]And to think that some cats will never even notice. The flowers sing with their many vibrant colors and dance as they stir in the breeze, but for what audience?","[thinking]I go sometimes to the riverbanks and watch the sunrise over the surface of the water.///[neutral]It leaps up from below the horizon in a burst of flame and warmth, amplified by its reflection across the waves.///[playful]I like to think that a little bit of that fire falls from the sky and is absorbed into myself.",[neutral]Did you look up at the sky when the sun began to set? It put on quite a show for us tonight. Like a painting set upon a lofty canvas was the falling of the sun behind the hills.///[shocked]If only I could run to the top of the tallest hill and pluck that canvas from its place in the sky and bring it home.///[neutral]I would do so if only to look an hour longer upon its radiance.,"[thinking]What is it about the moon that we find so captivating? She is a queen among the stars. Many poems have been written while the author was bathed in her soft glow.///[neutral]Some nights I stand outside and look up at the sky until I feel a sense of awe. It cleanses the emotions to do so, yes?///[thinking]I always sleep well afterwards. Perhaps tonight will be one of those nights.","[neutral]It has been a long day for #npc_name_zephyr#, and I have accomplished much. My dreams will be sweet tonight and filled with the essence of victory and success.",[playful]Today my heart soars within my chest. My spirit is lifted and there is no challenge too great for #npc_name_zephyr# to overcome.///[happy]Stay clear unless you wish to be washed away by the current of my success!,"[angry]After all the hours I spent on my hair this morning this fog rolled in. Now no cat can even see and appreciate my toil.///[sad]I have an appearance to maintain for my fans, you see. They have come to expect nothing less than perfection from me on every front, including and especially my good looks.///[happy]And I do look amazing, I assure you. I always do.","[blushing]Ah, #player_name#, I have something to tell you! You look ravishing in the rain. A little moisture does your fur much good it would seem.///[playful]Do not be embarrassed by this observation! #npc_name_zephyr# speaks only truth. Your looks have charmed me greatly for me to speak so boldly.","[neutral]Have you ever gone sledding, #player_name#? Perhaps I can find a piece of tree bark large enough to use as a makeshift sled.///[happy]Then we could hop on together and ride down the tallest hill we could find.///[playful]Great fun for all, yes? Plus it would greatly humor me to see the look on your face.",[happy]Hear the howling in the trees and the cracking of the thunder! The sky is composing a new symphony for all of us to enjoy.///[neutral]Boom! Goes the drums. Sing! Says the whistling wind.///[playful]To some it is a cacophony of dissonant sounds but to me it is music.,"[playful]Your fur is looking whiter than usual, #player_name#. Have you been out in the blizzard for long?///[happy]Make sure you take some time to warm up. Don't stay outside too long today. It is no good to become a frozen cat icicle!","[shocked]#player_name#, I will tell you quickly and privately that you need to rest and recover before you head out in public.///[thinking]It would do no good for the other residents of #colony_title_with_article# to see you in such a sad state. They must see our #leader_title# as strong and resilient!///[playful]But do not worry, I will watch over things in your stead while you are healing up. Do not thank me now, it is a service I am grateful to provide.","[playful]Oh, you have run out of food and now you come around like a beggar to sit and moan until it is thrown your way?///[thinking]It is quite unthinkable for a #leader_title# to act in such a way. No no, #player_name#, you must hunt your own prey. You will find no pity from me.","[angry]After everything you did, you think I would want to have a conversation with the likes of you?///[angry]No no, #npc_name_zephyr# will not be dragged down by a trivial cat such as yourself.","[neutral]It is the fate of every cat to stumble forward into the future, guided only by our intuition and desires.///[thinking]Some cats let their intuition overcome their desires, and they find success but not happiness.///[neutral]Others may give way to their desires and find happiness at the expense of their success.///[happy]That is why I am proud to have found both. My desires have brought me much success, as you can no doubt see.","[playful]I have been called a passionate cat, for my passions are all-consuming to me.///[thinking]Like a fire they consume my time and my energy until they are accomplished. And the flame burns bright and hot within my chest.///[neutral]We are very alike, me and you, are we not #player_name#? Yes, I can read it in your eyes. I can see the light from the fire that burns inside you too.","[playful]You slept well last night, yes #player_name#? There is vitality in your step and a smile upon your face.///[happy]Not so for everyone around town, it would seem! I have met many a grouchy cat today.///[neutral]But it is no matter. I know they are not upset with me. No cat can stay angry at #npc_name_zephyr# for long.","[neutral]I heard much about you before I met you, #player_name#. There are stories and legends of your exploits that have spread far and wide.///[playful]You are a cat of high quality. And that is why I am happy to consider you as one of my many fans. Not all of them are as accomplished as you.///[thinking]Some, it should be said, are higher on my list of favorites than you at the moment. But perhaps in time that will change?///[playful]I will give you a high placement to start to account for your efforts, but number 1 is a spot you must earn!","[playful]Do I fascinate you, #player_name#? I am a cat of many stories and many secrets, but only a select few will ever know the true #npc_name_zephyr#.///[happy]For my part, I am curious about you. I wish to know your history, your stories, the desires of your heart.///[playful]I am sure that in time we will share many things with one another.","[thinking]A cat may toil all day stalking prey in the field and come home empty-handed, but their work was not in vain.///[thinking]They have learned a thousand ways to not catch a [green]mouse[/green]. This lesson will improve their chances tomorrow.","[playful]Come closer, #player_name#, for I am about to share a piece of wisdom from the treasured philosophy of #npc_name_zephyr#!///[thinking]Many cats would pay a pretty price for such a tidbit, though to you I will dispense this wisdom for free. Just this one time!///[neutral]How should a cat behave? What is the right thing to do?///[playful]For #npc_name_zephyr#, the answer is simple. I do whatever it is that makes my heart sing.///[neutral]Now you may go forth, armed with this newfound wisdom. Do you not feel edified? You are most welcome.","[shocked]It can be ever so difficult to be so handsome and admired! It is a burden that we both share, #player_name#, so I feel that I can confide this all in you.///[sad]What do you do when every cat needs your attention at all times? How then can you have any time left for yourself?","[neutral]#player_name#, have you ever been swept away completely in a moment of rapturous passion?///[thinking]Where all the world seems to pause around you and your mind becomes so clear and focused on that one thing that you must do or else go mad?///[thinking]Many long years has it been since last I felt an emotion of that sheer intensity. But I would give anything to feel it again! So I must try.///[neutral]This is why I align my actions with my passions. One day the stars will align and I will once again be swept away. It always seems to arrive when you least expect it.","[playful]Always there is music that plays within my head. Songs from a life once lived, songs from today, and even songs that have never before been sung nor heard.///[happy]Do you hear it too, #player_name#?","[neutral]Some cats think me delusional for all this talk of having fans when they never see me in a large group, but they do not see the mail that arrives each morning!///[thinking]You see, many of my fans are my ex-lovers, and they do not live nearby for they could not stand to be in my presence and let their passions devour them whole.///[neutral]But often they will write me letters to beg me to return to them. These advances I have thus far denied!","[neutral]I have lived many lives. I have gone many places. I have done many things. I have seen many sights.///[playful]Much like yourself, I do not doubt it. Would you kindly share a story of your time before coming to the Wildwood? I would be eager to hear it. Plus, it would cure this boredom that has gripped me so.","[playful]Some cats are so serious all of the time. I do not know how they get enjoyment out of life.///[happy]That is why I like to poke fun. It is not done with a malicious intent. It is done to lighten the mood, yes?","[happy]If ever I am accused of being over-confident, that's because I am. Confidence is key to tackling all of life's many problems. It is not a flaw.///[thinking]I learned at a young age that if you do not stand up for yourself you will get trampled and forgotten. You see, I had 10 siblings. I did not wish to be lost in the shuffle.///[neutral]So I puffed out my chest, held my head high, and said what was on my mind. Now look at where it has gotten me and how far I have come.",[thinking]I have often thought about taking a trip to visit one of my previous homes. It is a long journey and many miles from here.///[neutral]Perhaps I will not. I moved on from that life years ago and doubtless the cats who live there now will be different than how I know them to be in my memory.///[thinking]Or perhaps I will wake up one sunny morning with the spirit of adventure burning in my chest and head out on the road to begin my journey.///[neutral]I will let my heart serve as a guide for me in this matter.,"[neutral]There are cats who wake up every morning and curse the name of #npc_name_zephyr#, but there are also cats like you who call me 'friend'.///[thinking]Who then is the real #npc_name_zephyr#? The cat who hurts the ones who give them all their love, or the cat who is beloved by those who choose to stay near?","[thinking]There is a great weight placed upon cats in my position. What if I do something that my fans do not like and I end up letting them down?///[playful]Bah, such nonsense! I would never disappoint my fans. After all, I am #npc_name_zephyr#!",[neutral]I once tried to live alone in a beautiful den set on many acres of gorgeous land.///[playful]But it was not for #npc_name_zephyr#! I am a social creature. I need the loving adoration of my fans and the smiles of my neighbors to keep my heart happy.,"[playful]#player_name#, you look charming as always. You must tell me your all your secrets, for I much desire to emulate them for myself.///[happy]If I cannot be the most captivating cat around, I will happily settle for second place!","[happy]You must go after what you want. Be direct, be assertive, be confident. There's no greater spokesperson for your best interests than you.","[thinking]Did you have any time to think about what we could do as a couple? Just the two of us? Perhaps a date, or a special gift?///[sad]Never mind, it seems you have other things on your mind... As usual.","[neutral]There is a strength within you that I did not see before. Not a strength of the body, but a strength of the spirit.///[blushing]Now that we are dating, I do not know how I could have missed it.","[blushing]I have wrote many songs about you, #player_name#! I sing them to myself when I am out and about and all alone.///[playful]While I'm sure you would love to hear them, I will not repeat them now. But rest assured that they speak very highly of your character.",[happy]I think about you often as I go about my day. Every flower in every field reminds me of your captivating beauty. That is why I call you my blossom.///[blushing]But even more beautiful than all the wildflowers combined is my #player_name#.,"[playful]My blossom, perhaps we could go out and pick some flowers today?///[happy]I would cherish a little of your time, for there is no greater pleasure in all of life than to be by your side for a moment.","[playful]I am working on a present for you, my blossom. I will not reveal what it is just yet, but one day soon I will hopefully deliver it into your paws.///[happy]I have been told by many cats that I have a knack for picking excellent gifts, so please do set your expectations high. I will surely meet them with ease.","[blushing]You are as lovely as ever, my blossom. A rose among thorns is my #player_name#.///[thinking]As delicate as a petal, yet also a well of great strength. You are quite a mystery to #npc_name_zephyr#.","[happy]My heart rejoices to see you in such a lively mood, #player_name#. Nothing but smiles and sunshine for my blossom. I will do everything in my power to ensure that.","[playful]You are stunning, my blossom. My thoughts rest often upon you and there they linger.///[blushing]It is my greatest pleasure to call you mine.","[neutral]You are often curious of my history, yes #player_name#? I sense that your curiosity us unbounded.///[playful]Yes, it is true that #npc_name_zephyr# is an irresistible mystery to every cat. In time you will know all, my blossom.","[thinking]When I first come to a new town, I think to myself, '#npc_name_zephyr#, you can have any cat for your own. Who then shall you pursue?'///[playful]And it is true, is it not? For I am both exceptionally talented and handsome. There is no denying this fact.///[thinking]I always set my sights high. But to call #leader_title_with_article# my blossom... This is a goal I have never before achieved.///[happy]There is nothing that can come between #npc_name_zephyr# and my goals.///[blushing]For have I not sunk my claws into your heart? It is precisely as I had planned from the start.","[thinking]In the summer of my youth I made many mistakes in love.///[shocked]Yes, do not look so surprised, for even a mighty cat like #npc_name_zephyr# is permitted one or two missteps.///[neutral]Always have I taken my experiences to heart. I will not repeat the mistakes of my past. I will not allow my passion to cloud my judgment and destroy the one I love.","[playful]The highest fruit from the tallest tree, the most delicious prey from the most distant corner of the world... Say the word, #player_name#, and it is yours.///[blushing]I will stop at nothing to see you smile, my blossom.",[neutral]There is something so romantic about today. It is as though the very air is thick with love itself and all the world is drenched in a colorful haze...///[playful]I feel as though I am living in a poem.,"[neutral]Your voice is a soothing balm to my soul, my blossom. Each morning I crave to hear you once again.///[playful]And when it is lifted in song... My heart swoons! Would you sing for me, #player_name#?///[happy]Yes, a beautiful noise. Not nearly as pitch perfect as #npc_name_zephyr#, but with practice and instruction you will no doubt be a close second, yes?","[thinking]Have you put something new in your hair? Your scent has a floral quality about it. Mmm, yes, as sweet as a fresh flower.///[playful]You will not mind if I get a little closer to take it in, yes? It is quite irresistible.","[happy]Happy are these days, and happier still to call them mine. Is there any nectar as sweet as romance?///[neutral]Yet #npc_name_zephyr# has been in love before. No, this is something more. The sweetest nectar of the sweetest flowering fruit.","[neutral]I have never had a problem finding romance, for cats would fall for #npc_name_zephyr# wherever I went. It is a blessing and a curse.///[thinking]However, my relationships have never been... how do you say it... as 'long-term' as ours, you see.///[shocked]There would always come a point at which the feeling would fade and we went our separate ways, yes?///[thinking]But our love... Our love is different, my blossom. I cannot put my paw on it, but something has changed within #npc_name_zephyr#.","[thinking]When I was a young cat, I fell for a gorgeous cat with sparkling green eyes that danced in the light like a thousand fireflies.///[neutral]I was quite smitten. Many years have passed, but even the memory of our love leaves my heart aching with sadness and grief.///[thinking]You see, one day my love left and never returned. Just wandered off to find some new cat's heart to break in some other corner of the world, I am sure.///[shocked]Since then I have been afraid of getting too carried away in a relationship.///[thinking]What if I were to subject myself to the same hurt as before? No. My heart would surely break beyond repair.","[blushing]In your eyes there is a universe, deep and rich and wonderous to behold. I could stare into them forever, my blossom.","[happy]When you approach my heart sings a song that is beyond words. Never could I even begin to attempt to repeat it with my lips.///[blushing]It is a transcendent symphony of beautiful music that only the soul can comprehend! Surely you hear it too, for you are a cat in love!","[sad]Love is a double-edged sword and it always runs its course in the end. There is pleasure and there is beauty, and then there is longing and there is despair.///[thinking]The tide shifts once again. I have seen it happen many times. Is there no way to escape the rising waters that abound?","[neutral]Together we shall weave a great quilt of our love. Two lives, intertwined, each distinct in palette and material.///[thinking]Yet together they are more beautiful than either ever was alone.","[playful]We have now entered into the autumntime of our love, #player_name#.///[blushing]Things slow down as we settle in to our den, yet the beauty of the world around us is enhanced beyond belief as the changing leaves of fall.///[neutral]Let us enjoy this special moment and not forget to soak it in while it lasts.","[blushing]It is as though my every emotion is amplified to five, no, ten times what it used to be! I feel my passion burning brighter and hotter than ever before.///[happy]It is the plight of the love-stricken, I suppose. Romance touches all that we do in life.","[happy]What has happened? Is #npc_name_zephyr# finally settling down? Yes, it is true, my blossom.///[playful]I must discover all there is to know about this new #npc_name_zephyr#. It shall be quite a challenge. Lucky for us both I am a very talented cat who does not fear such a fate!","[thinking]All my years of gallantry have led to this moment. Now we are one, my blossom and I.///[blushing]I will not lie, it was a rocky journey to finally find a love that could match my own. I am glad we met, #player_name#.","[neutral]We are two, yet we must act as one. This is a great mystery, yes #player_name#? For how can two cats align their thoughts for all their lives?///[happy]You are fortunate to have such an intelligent cat for a partner. I will always make choices that benefit us both, this is my promise to you.","[happy]Perhaps you can help me sort through some of my fan mail later today?///[shocked]The pile has grown out of control and I must admit I have become quite overwhelmed.///[playful]Does it make you jealous, my blossom? No no no, you must understand. My heart will always beat for only you.",[neutral]I am thinking I will venture out to collect some flowers for the den.///[thinking]The atmosphere inside is lacking a certain perfumed quality that can only come from fresh blooms.,[playful]The sound of your voice is like poetry to my ears. It stirs something within me that is beyond description.///[neutral]Do you know what it is like to look upon a beautiful sight for the very first time? That is how I feel when I hear you speak.,"[blushing]It pleases me to converse with you, my blossom, for I always learn something new about my #player_name#.///[happy]It is ever so satisfying to get to know the depths of your soul. I must know everything there is to know about my blossom! In time no doubt I will.","[playful]Many cats pine for #npc_name_zephyr#, yet the heart of #npc_name_zephyr# pines only for you.///[thinking]I hope it does not worry you, my blossom. I could have any cat I choose, yet I choose to be with you. Is that not comforting?","[thinking]Love requires that we reach deep inside ourselves and scrape the very bottom of our longings to discover who we truly are.///[neutral]Then we must communicate those longings to one another.///[shocked]It is a very vulnerable thing to do!///[happy]That is why I am glad to have you as my lover, #player_name#. You are ever so understanding.","[neutral]I awoke yearning for my love, but you were already gone, off on some adventure no doubt.///[happy]I miss you dearly when you are not near at hand. I am hopelessly, madly in love with my blossom!","[happy]My exploits and my deeds are known far and wide, but my most infamous by far is taking you for my own.///[playful]You should read the letters I receive from fans who are clearly displeased that I am happily married. It is quite entertaining to #npc_name_zephyr#.","[neutral]Have you noticed anything new about the den? No?///[playful]Ah, forget I said anything. It was nothing, I assure you!","[blushing]I am infatuated with you, #player_name#. My heart is wholly devoted to you.///[happy]It pleases me to know that you also are mad about me. May it always be so.","[playful]It must make you smile to call yourself my lover. Surely there was no harder cat in all #colony_title_with_article# to woo, yes?///[happy]But you are persistent and you wore down my defenses. Only an exceptional cat such as yourself could have done such a thing.","[thinking]Time will march onwards, and seasons will pass, but our love will remain.///[blushing]There is such security and reassurance in our commitment to one another.","[happy]You have taught me many things, #player_name#, and I am forever grateful for your patience and your love.///[thinking]For I knew much of romance, but what did I know of love prior to meeting you? It is shameful to admit, but I knew very little indeed.///[blushing]Love such as yours is a rare and unexpected thing.",[playful]Have ever two cats so skilled and so strong aligned their efforts as effortlessly as we?///[playful]Let us do everything we can to make today another amazing day.,"[playful]Make sure your children know how lucky they are to be growing up in a #colony_title# as prosperous as ours.///[happy]How many groups of cats have a doctor like #npc_name_krampy#, or a warrior like #npc_name_talon#, or a star such as myself? Not many, I can assure you of that.",[neutral]There are many products which I must purchase in order to maintain my luscious mane of fur.///[shocked]It costs many [yellow]Mews[/yellow] to keep it soft and silky.///[playful]But I am a selfless cat and I will do what I must to appease my many fans.,"[thinking]You are familiar with the one called #npc_name_glimmer#, are you not?///[angry]They spoke strange words to me yesterday.
